She squeezes my hand.<br>
My thoughts wonder to a time long ago.<br>
It's a sunny afternoon.<br>
My two brothers an I look up at this beautiful lady smiling at us.<br>
"Let's stand in a line, and at the count of three, we run across the 
park to see who is the fastest...", she says<br>
Her eyes full of excitement, full of joy, full of love.<br>
</p>
<p>
She squeezes my hand, and mumbles something incomprehensible ...<br>
Mom, what are you trying to say?<br>
</p>
<p>
My mom (and dad) always made sure we had food, even if it was only a plate of potatoes.<br>
<strong>POTATOES, the ultimate nourishment, the ultimate gift of love, the ultimate sacrifice...</strong><br>
You don't believe me, just ask my wife ...<br>
She squeezes my hand ...<br>
</p>
<p>
Mom left her parents, travelled the great seas, to join my my dad.<br>
All this to give us a better life ...<br>
She squeezes my hand , says something incomprehensible ...<br>
</p>
<p>
My dad worked far away, so my mom was left with the task of keeping us safe.<br>
<strong>Even if it meant hiding us under her skirt while she crossed the ...</strong><br>
</p>
<p>
My thoughts are interrupted, <strong>I feel her squeezing my hand ...</strong><br>
How I wish I understood what she tried to say to me.<br>
<strong>You see, it was the last time she SQUEEZED MY HAND AND SAID SOMETHING TO ME ...</strong><br>
</p>
<p>
I CAN STILL FEEL HER SQUEEZING MY HAND ...<br>
Love you, my dearest mother...<br>
Forever missed ...<br>
</p>
