Colton Harris Moore (born March 22, 1991) is an American former fugitive.
He was charged with the theft of hundreds of thousands of dollars in property, including several small aircraft, boats, and multiple cars, all committed while still a teenager.

He fled to the Bahamas on July 4, 2010, allegedly in a plane stolen from Bloomington, Indiana.
He was indicted on July 6, 2010, by a U.S. Federal Court in Seattle, Washington, on charges of transporting another stolen aircraft in that state.
Moore, still only 19, was arrested in Harbour Island, Bahamas, on July 11, 2010, after police shot out the engine of the boat in which he was attempting to flee.
