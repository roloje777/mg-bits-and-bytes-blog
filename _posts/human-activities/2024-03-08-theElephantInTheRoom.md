Human emissions of greenhouse gases are the primary driver of climate change today.

CO2 and other greenhouse gases like methane and nitrous oxide are emitted when we burn fossil fuels, produce materials such as steel, cement, and plastics, and grow the food we eat.  
If we want to reduce these emissions, we need to transform our energy systems, industries, and food systems.

    </div>
<h4>The Paris Agreement</h4>
<br>
The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change.<br> 
It was adopted by 196 Parties at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris, France, on 12 December 2015.<br> 
It entered into force on 4 November 2016.<br>
<br>
The Paris Agreement is a landmark in the multilateral climate change process because, for the first time, a binding agreement brings all nations together to combat climate change and adapt to its effects.<br>
<br>
Since 2020, countries have been submitting their national climate action plans, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs)<br>
<br>
With the Paris Agreement, countries established an enhanced <strong>transparency framework (ETF) </strong>.<br> 
Under ETF, starting in 2024, countries will report transparently on actions taken and progress in climate change mitigation, adaptation measures and support provided or received.<br>  
It also provides for international procedures for the review of the submitted reports.<br>

    </div>
<h4>The Military</h4>
<br>
As a whole, militaries are among the world's biggest consumers of fuel, accounting for 5.5 percent of global emissions, according to a recent report, published by CCP and UK think tank Common Wealth. By comparison civil aviation accounts for around 2 percent.<br>
<br>
Amounts allocated to green initiatives pale in comparison with the hundreds of billions spent on the US military each year.<br>
<br>
<strong>The US military emits more than entire industrialised nations like Portugal and Denmark, yet evades scrutiny. </strong><br>

    </div>
<h4>The Climate Impact of War</h4>
<br>
The ravages of war leave behind them a trail of horrifying destruction, with far and long-reaching consequences, one of which is climate change.<br>
<br>
Direct GHG emissions from warfare alone have nearly reached 37 million tCO2e, with fuel consumption by Russian troops emitting the bulk of it.<br>  
Another significant source of emission at 22.2 million tCO2e is fires, much of which started from the front line and led to the destruction of forested areas.<br>

Defense spending by the United States accounted for nearly 40 percent of military expenditures by countries around the world in 2022, according to recently released figures from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).<br> 
U.S. defense spending increased by $71 billion from 2021 to 2022, in part due to a military aid sent to support Ukraine in its ongoing conflict, and the United States now spends more on defense than the next 10 countries combined (up from outspending the next 9 countries combined in 2021).<br>

<br>
At a record €240 billion, 2022 European defence spending again increased by 6% on the previous year, marking the eighth year of consecutive growth. 20 of the 27 EU Member States increased defence expenditure, with six increasing spending by over 10%.<br>

Defence spending with UK industry by the Ministry of Defence has topped £25 billion for the first time, official statistics have revealed.<br>
The 2022/23 statistics, published today, detail the money spent by the MOD with UK defence companies.<br>

<h4>The Elephant in the room</h4>

When it comes to taking stock of global emissions, there's an elephant in the room: the world's armed forces.<br>
<br>
<strong>Defence forces are <b style="color:red;font-size:2em">not</b> bound by international climate agreements to report or cut their carbon emissions, and the data that is published by some militaries is unreliable or incomplete at best, scientists and academics say.</strong> <br>
That's because military emissions abroad, from flying jets to sailing ships to training exercises, <strong>were left out of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol on reducing greenhouse gases - and exempted again from the 2015 Paris accords - on the grounds that data about energy use by armies could undermine national security.</strong><br>
