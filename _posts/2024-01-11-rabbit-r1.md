R1 is a pocket-sized gadget wih artificial intelligence.
Now what makes it different from current devices, such as our mobile phones, is that it is powered by a Large Action Model (LAM) that not only allows you to speak to te device using a Large Language Model (LLM) such as ChatGPT, but the device actually does the <strong>actions</strong> for you.
In other words you can not only ask R1 for prices of tickets on a trip you're planning, but R1 by Rabbit will actually do the booking etc for you.

When I saw this on YouTube the following quotes came to mind.

- Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me.
- Actions are stronger than words.

> Now with the R1, things just became a bit blurrier.  
> Words may just break ones bones as actions and words become one.
