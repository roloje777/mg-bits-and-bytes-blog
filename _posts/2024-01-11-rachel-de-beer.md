Twelve year old Rachel de Beer, her six year younger brother, and parents were camping on property belonging
to friends in the South Eastern Transvaal, South Africa.
They were part of a wagon train making a shift corral.

They noticed that a calf, that they loved so much, was not with the
herd.
The whole camp, including Rachel and her brother joined the search
party.

They got separated from the search party, and she only noticed when
they got lost.
It started snowing and was already dusk.
They searched for the wagon train but to no avail.

They were desperate and freezing.
Rachel came across an ant hill that probably had been hollowed out by
an aardvark.
She knew that they were in a life threatening situation, so she told
her little brother to get into the ant hill.

Her brother was getting worse, so she stripped off her clothing, covered her
brother and put him back in the hollow.
She then covered the opening with her body, thus keeping her brother
warm and safe.
She eventually succumbed to hypothermia.

Rachel was found the following morning by a search party, her
lifeless body still covering the enclosure.
Her brother was still alive.
Rachel sacrificed herself to save her little brother.

This took place between 1830 and 1860 and is documented as a
true event.
