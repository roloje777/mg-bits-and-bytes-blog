> Having lost three pillars in my family in less than a year, I find myself in a state of profound despair and sorrow.  
> A pain that only those who have had the misfortune of experiencing similar or even deeper anguish will identify what I am going through.  
> Such an affliction, a catastrophic event that removes your soul from under your feet.  
> It feels like the pillars that hold your temple, your very soul, that on which your life essence is built on, is no longer there.  
> Like Samson has brought down your world by ripping the pillars from your soul.
>
> Yet, one must carry on.  
> There are others that are left behind.  
> Others that I form part of.  
> I am one of the pillars that hold their souls intact.
>
> Now, how does one carry such a weight on a fragile pillar?  
> A soul, a soul that feels like it has been shattered into a million pieces, like a broken glass that was accidentally dropped onto the floor.  
> How do I pick up these broken pieces and make them whole again?  
> An unexpurgated soul.

 <p style="color:red; position:relative; text-align:center">Mental health and resilience - the secrets of inner strength | DW Documentary</p>

Around one billion people struggle with stress-related illness globally – and that figure is rising.  
What protects those with good mental health?  
Is their resilience innate?  
Or is the ability to withstand chronic stress and crisis something that can be learned?

In the largest European resilience center in Mainz, Germany, researchers conducted a long-term study to explore the mechanisms deployed by people who enjoy good mental health despite stress and crisis.

Topics discussed?

- why does it happen to some people and not to others?
- how does one stay healthy, even under such catastrophic events?
- can we learn to be resilient?
- the role friends and family play in such an event.
- it's OK, you don't have to cope.
- for some, it's a long journey to recovery.. for others ...?
- what are the risk factors to mental illness?
- how positive people tend to be more resilient.
- the role of genetics and cortisol and how it has an influence on how we react to stress.
- how a stressful pregnancy can influence the child's resilience and mental health later in life.
- how the MAOA gene affects our happiness gene.
- resilience is developed gradually.

<br>
    ... resilience means finding ways to deal with stress... does not mean you should try to cope with as much stress as possible... plan time to relax, to compensate, ... that increases overall resilience... to be able to cope better...<br>
<br>
    ... government and society also play a role in creating an environment to enhance our resilience...<br>

    ... the scars will remain forever ...<br>

    ... you move through life with much more awareness ...<br>
<br>
    ... resilience is not a state of being, but rather a continuous process...<br>
<br>
    ... our psyche is a complex mix of environmental influences, genes, and our ability to act...<br>
<br>
    ... resilience is not about happiness, is about living with all of life's grey areas, surviving crisis without losing one's mental health, to have a realistic understanding...<br>
<br>
    ... one's resilience is never perfect...<br>

[Boris Cyrulnik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Cyrulnik), <strong>a pioneer in resilience, believes that, when it comes to resilient behaviour, it’s not just down to us - society and politics also have a responsibility to create appropriate conditions for stable psychological health.  
Our experiences, our environment, and our genes all influence our powers of mental resilience.  
Resilience isn’t a magic word or a promise of happiness but a life-long learning process.</strong>
