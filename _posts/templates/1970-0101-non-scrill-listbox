    For instance, Swedenborg describes how, when the bodily functions of
    respiration and circulation cease:
  </ul>
  "Still man does not die, but is only separated from the corporeal part which
  was of use to him in the world ... Man, when he dies, only passes from one
  world into another."<br />
