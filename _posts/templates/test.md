   Viriathus hailed from Lusitania, which occupied parts of modern-day Portugal and western Spain. He was a shepherd who in childhood lived in the mountains . Accounts recall his great strength and agility, the result of a spare diet and hard physical labour.
He lived around 2nd century BC.
He lead the Lusitanians to conquer stratigic areas such as: Segóbriga, La Mancha and Bética.

The confrontation of Erisane (located in the south of Andalusia), Viriato stopped the Roman forces in 141 BC., where he managed to siege the army led by Fábio Máximo Serviliano.

   Servilianus was sent to Hispania Ulterior and was given command of the Lusitanian War. He took with him two legions and a number of allied forces, totaling 18,000 infantry and 1,600 cavalry. He asked King Micipsa, the king of Numidia, for some elephants, and received ten elephants and 300 cavalry.
Viriathus was around 6000 men strong.

Following this decisive confrontation, an agreement was reached with Serviliano. Viriathus accepted the agreement on behalf of his people and the Roman Senate recognized the independence of the Lusitanians, who now have the status of amicus populi romani (which means “friends of the Roman people”).
