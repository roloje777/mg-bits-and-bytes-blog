During several of Swedenborg's near-death experiences, he would witness people dying and see their happenings in the afterlife. He stated that immediately following death, there is a period of self-discovery in which the social masks worn on Earth dissolve away and the true self is revealed. Each person then shapes their own eternity to correspond with their real inner nature. Some people become irrational, driven by fear and greed. Such people are in the spiritual condition which Swedenborg called hell. Hell is a psychological condition which corresponds to the suffering we experience on Earth when we allow ourselves to be driven by the blind greed of our own egos. There are no devils in hell to inflict punishments because in the hellish spiritual state each person acts out their own malice by tormenting others.

After death, most people find within themselves the psychological state Swedenborg called heaven. It is a joyous condition and a state of expanded awareness, of perceiving more and more of the grand plan of creation. The heaven which Swedenborg experienced, corresponds to deeds, not creeds. Therefore, persons from many cultures and religions form the societies of heaven. Swedenborg often mentioned that these societies, the Church of the Lord, are universal. This Church of the Lord consists of all those who have lived in the goodness of love according to their own spiritual life on Earth.

<strong> Now according to Dr. Moddy, Swedenborg's writings provide striking parallels to the events of contemporary near-death experiences.

### Emanuel Swedenborg

Among the liberal thinkers enjoying the freedom to consider heterodox ideas was [Emanuel Swedenborg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emanuel_Swedenborg) (1688â€“1772).  
Swedenborg was a scientist who had a spiritual awakening through a revelation.  
He was told by Jesus Christ, who he met in a vision, to write The Heavenly Doctrine, a 1758 account of his visit to heaven and hell where, apart from Christ, he was afforded the opportunity to converse with angels and demons.

His writings were filled with symbolism.  
Swedenborg often used stones to represent truth, snakes for evil, houses for intelligence, and cities for religious systems.  
He also described the appearance of heaven in great detail, as well as inhabitants from other planets.

### The Heavenly Doctrine

According to The Heavenly Doctrine, the Last Judgment took place not in the physical world but in the World of Spirits,
halfway between heaven and hell, through which all pass on their way to heaven or hell.  
The Judgment took place because the Christian church had lost its charity and faith, resulting in a loss of spiritual free will that threatened the equilibrium between heaven and hell in everyone's life.  
The Heavenly Doctrine also teaches that the Last Judgement was followed by the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, which occurred not by Christ in person but by a revelation from him through the inner, spiritual sense of the Word through Swedenborg.

In Earths in the Universe, it is stated that he conversed with spirits from Jupiter, Mars, Mercury, Saturn, Venus and the Moon,as well as spirits from planets beyond the Solar System.  
From the "encounters", he concluded that the planets of the Solar System are inhabited and that such an enormous undertaking as the universe could not have been created for just one race on a planet or one "Heaven" derived from its properties per planet.  
Many Heavenly societies were also needed to increase the perfection of the angelic Heavens and Heaven to fill in deficiencies and gaps in other societies.  
He argued: "What would this be to God, Who is infinite, and to whom a thousand or tens of thousands of planets, and all of them full of inhabitants, would be scarcely anything!"

Emanuel Swedenborg was a scientist, inventor, and theologian who made significant discoveries in many of the natural sciences, including astronomy, anatomy, geology, and mineralogy.  
At age fifty-five, his intensive search for answers to ultimate questions culminated in an awakening that gave him
a unique insight into the workings of the spiritual world.  
He spent the remainder of his life writing about his experiences and how human beings can come to a deeper awareness of the divine.

Swedenborg's ideas have influenced people as diverse as Helen Keller, Johnny Appleseed, William Blake, Henry James, Ralph Waldo Emerson, D.T.Suzuki, Jorge Luis Borges, and Dr. Mehmet Oz.  
The continuing appeal of his thought undoubtedly lies in his insights into the afterlife, concepts of divine love, and focus on personal and social development.

In Swedenborg's final hours <strong>(which he had predicted)</strong> his friend, Pastor Ferelius, told him
some people thought he had written his theology just to make a name for himself and asked Swedenborg if he would like to recant.  
Raising himself up on his bed, his hand on his heart, Swedenborg earnestly replied, <i>"As truly as you see me before your eyes, so true is everything that I have written; and I could have said more had it been permitted.  
When you enter eternity you will see everything, and then you and I shall have much to talk about".</i>
He then died, in the afternoon, on the date he had predicted,March 29, 1772.
