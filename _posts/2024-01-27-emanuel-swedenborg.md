Among the liberal thinkers enjoying the freedom to consider heterodox
ideas was [Emanuel Swedenborg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emanuel_Swedenborg) (1688â€“1772).  
Swedenborg was a scientist who had a spiritual awakening through
revelation.  
He was told by Jesus Christ, who he met in a vision, to write The
Heavenly Doctrine, a 1758 account of his visit to heaven and hell
where, apart from Christ, he was afforded the opportunity to converse
with angels and demons.

His writings were filled with symbolism.  
Swedenborg often used stones to represent truth, snakes for evil,
houses for intelligence, and cities for religious systems.  
He also described the appearance of heaven in great detail, as well as
inhabitants from other planets.

### The Heavenly Doctrine

According to The Heavenly Doctrine, the Last Judgment took place not
in the physical world but in the World of Spirits,
halfway between heaven and hell, through which all pass on their way
to heaven or hell.  
The Judgment took place because the Christian church had lost its
charity and faith, resulting in a loss of spiritual free will that
threatened the equilibrium between heaven and hell in everyone's life.  
The Heavenly Doctrine also teaches that the Last Judgement was
followed by the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, which occurred not by
Christ in person but by a revelation from him through the inner,
spiritual sense of the Word[58] through Swedenborg.

In Earths in the Universe, it is stated that he conversed with spirits
from Jupiter, Mars, Mercury, Saturn, Venus and the Moon,as well as
spirits from planets beyond the Solar System.  
From the "encounters", he concluded that the planets of the Solar
System are inhabited and that such an enormous undertaking as the
universe could not have been created for just one race on a planet or
one "Heaven" derived from its properties per planet.  
Many Heavenly societies were also needed to increase the perfection of
the angelic Heavens and Heaven to fill in deficiencies and gaps in
other societies.  
He argued: "What would this be to God, Who is infinite, and to whom a
thousand or tens of thousands of planets, and all of them full of
inhabitants, would be scarcely anything!"

Emanuel Swedenborg was a scientist, inventor, and theologian who made significant discoveries
in many of the natural sciences, including astronomy, anatomy,
geology, and mineralogy.  
At age fifty-five, his intensive search for
answers to ultimate questions culminated in an awakening that gave him
a unique insight into the workings of the spiritual world.  
He spent the remainder of his life writing about his experiences and
how human beings can come to a deeper awareness of the divine.

Swedenborg's ideas have influenced people as diverse as Helen Keller,
Johnny Appleseed, William Blake, Henry James, Ralph Waldo Emerson,
D.T.Suzuki, Jorge Luis Borges, and Dr. Mehmet Oz.  
The continuing appeal of his thought undoubtedly lies in his insights
into the afterlife, concepts of divine love, and focus on personal and
social development.

In Swedenborg's final hours <strong>(which he had predicted)</strong> his friend, Pastor Ferelius, told him
some people thought he had written his theology just to make a name
for himself and asked Swedenborg if he would like to recant.  
Raising himself up on his bed, his hand on his heart, Swedenborg earnestly replied,  
<i>"As truly as you see me before your eyes, so true is everything that
I have written; and I could have said more had it been permitted.
When you enter eternity you will see everything, and then you and I
shall have much to talk about".</i>

He then died, in the afternoon, on the date he had predicted,March 29, 1772.
