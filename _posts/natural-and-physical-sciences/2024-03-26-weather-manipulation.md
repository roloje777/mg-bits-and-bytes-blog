    <h4>How climate change will affect generations to come</h4>
    A Washington Post report dated the 21 March 2023 describes that the overall, the degree of warmth — and the subsequent health of the environment, wildlife, and ourselves — can still be altered depending on policies and actions taken today.<br>
    The current implemented policies would put global temperatures around 3.2 degrees of warming by 2100 — somewhere in the range of the “intermediate” or “high” pathway of future emissions scenarios depicted in the graphic.<br>

    Ruane stated that a person born in 1950 entered at around 0.25 degrees of warming compared to the late 1800s.<br>
    Today's septuagenarians (70 years old) has experienced 0.85 degrees of warming in their lifetime so far - around 0.12 degrees per decade...<br>
    He also stated that, the rate of warming to date was nearly 50 percent faster for those born in 1980 compared to those born in 1950.<br>
    For generation Alpha, the extent of warming highly depends on society’s response.<br>
    He emphasized that if we global warming to below 2 degrees, this generation could see climate stabilization before they are 30 years old.<br>

    <h4>Controlling the Weather</h4>
    <p>Chinese weather authorities successfully controlled the weather ahead of a major political celebration earlier this year, according to a Beijing university study.
    </p>
    <p>On 1 July the Chinese Communist party marked its centenary with major celebrations including tens of thousands of people at a ceremony in Tiananmen Square, and a research paper from Tsinghua University has said an extensive cloud-seeding operation in the hours prior ensured clear skies and low air pollution.
    </p>
    <p>The Chinese government has been an enthusiastic proponent of cloud-seeding technology, spending billions of dollars on efforts to manipulate the weather to protect agricultural regions or improve significant events, including the 2008 Olympics.
    </p>
    <p>Weather control, also known as weather modification or geoengineering, refers to the deliberate manipulation of natural weather patterns. It involves altering atmospheric conditions through various techniques, such as cloud seeding, ionization, or even the use of electromagnetic waves.

    <h4>Operation Popeye</h4>
    <p>Operation Popeye (Project Controlled Weather Popeye / Motorpool / Intermediary-Compatriot) was a military cloud-seeding project carried out by the U.S. Air Force during the Vietnam War in 1967–1972.<br>
    The highly classified program attempted to extend the monsoon season over specific areas of the Ho Chi Minh Trail in order to disrupt North Vietnamese military supplies by softening road surfaces and causing landslides.

    <h4>U.S. Military To Control The Weather Around The World By 2025</h4>
    <p>In recent years, there has been speculation about the United States military’s alleged pursuit of weather control capabilities, aiming to manipulate weather patterns worldwide by the year 2025.</p>
    <p>The article <a href="https://historyofyesterday.com/u-s-military-to-control-the-weather-around-the-world-by-2025/">U.S. Military To Control The Weather Around The World By 2025</a>, published by the Defense Technical Information Centre, delves into the concept of using weather control as a strategic advantage.<br>
    It suggests that the U.S. military aims to harness weather manipulation as a force multiplier, enabling them to influence the outcomes of military operations.</p>
    <p>The potential military applications of weather control technology are vast and multifaceted.<br>
    One primary objective could be to enhance or disrupt communication systems by manipulating atmospheric conditions that affect radio waves and satellite signals.<br>
    By controlling weather patterns, military forces could create strategic advantages by either enabling or impeding the enemy’s ability to coordinate operations effectively.</p>
    <p>Another potential application lies in using weather control to weaken or incapacitate adversaries.<br>
    For instance, the ability to trigger severe storms, hurricanes, or droughts could severely impact the agriculture and infrastructure of enemy nations, destabilizing their economies and diminishing their military capabilities.
    </p>
    <p>Weather control efforts must consider the potential unintended consequences and ecological impacts.<br>
    Altering weather patterns in one area may lead to unforeseen disruptions in other regions, affecting ecosystems, agricultural cycles, and water resources.</p>

    <p>The Beijing Weather Modification Office form a part of China's nationwide weather control effort, believed to be the world's largest; it employs 37,000 people nationwide, who seed clouds by firing rockets and shells loaded with silver iodide into them.</p>

    <h4>Geoengineering</h4>
    <p>Geoengineering refers to the large-scale manipulation of a specific process central to controlling and channelling the earth’s resources, such as those of the oceans, rivers, soil, and atmosphere.<br>
    These techniques are undergoing rapid development primarily to achieve sustainable development in the fields of agriculture, water resource management, energy generation, navigation, connectivity, and climate change mitigation.<br>
    Unfortunately, the use of these geoengineering techniques is not limited to such noble objectives; they can also be harnessed to dominate or subjugate other countries in a certain region.</p>
    <p>
      China has adopted a strategy of hybrid warfare against countries that it considers hostile or potentially hostile. Geoengineering has the potential to become a game-changing tool for Beijing’s implementation of a hybrid warfare strategy, especially in China’s neighbourhood.
    </p>
    <p>There are three main geoengineering techniques that have bolstered China’s or hybrid warfare capabilities.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Weather Modification</b><br>
        <p>According to a statement from China’s State Council, the country is committed to bringing about 5.5 million square kilometres of its land area under its weather modification program by 2025. Much of this involves the process of “cloud seeding.” China claims to have developed this technology to increase agricultural productivity and prevent natural disasters such as droughts and floods. However, the impact of cloud seeding can be seen beyond China’s borders, as it may disrupt the normal monsoon in neighbouring countries such as India, Myanmar, Vietnam, etc. This would have an adverse impact on agriculture in these countries, rising potentially to a form of “rain stealing.</p>
        <p>Weather medication may also be used to sabotage troop movements and logistics operations in border regions by artificially altering the rainy conditions, which would slow down the tactical movement of the adversary on a real-time basis.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>River Water Obstruction</b><br>
        <p>The ability to control the water flow gives China a strategic advantage over the lower riparian countries.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Construction of Artificial Islands</b><br>        
        <p>The region’s geostrategic importance has prompted China to conduct offensive activities such as the construction of artificial islands on the reefs and other features that it controls.<br>
        </p>
        <image-container-right>
            <img style="width:10em" src="https://i.insider.com/551ac22f6da811ec2084d435?width=1025&format=jpeg" alt="Great Wall Of Sand">
            <p>Great Wall Of Sand</p>
        </image-container-right>
        <p>These artificially constructed islands are being developed as military bases for the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) under its anti-access/area denial strategy.<br>
        This strategy aims at preventing any external military intervention in the disputed waters.<br>
        The unhindered construction of these islands in recent years highlights Beijing’s blatant disregard for the 2016 ruling of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which rejected China’s claims over the South China Sea.
