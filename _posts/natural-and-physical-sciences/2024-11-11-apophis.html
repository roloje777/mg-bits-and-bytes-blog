        It's the year 2029.<br>
        Johnny is cycling back home.<Br>
        His mom had sent him to "Meu Super", a local store is Alfândega da Fé 
        to purchase bread and milk.</br>
        Suddenly, there is such a bright light, a blinding light,<br>
        ...so bright he has never encountered.<br>
        It blinds him.<br>
        He cannot see where he is going and hits the pavement, falling off his bike.<br>
        Next he feels the earth tremble, followed by a deafening sound.<br>
        His ears are ringing, he rubs his eyes, slowly recovering from temporary blindness.<br>
        He looks up, and sees people running,<br>
         ... others standing and looking into the heavens.<br>
        A lady runs past him and shouts,"Run, run for your life.."<br>
        "save yourself  ..."<br>
        "Its Apophis, the god of destruction, the god of Chaos"<br>
        Johnny looks up ands sees a huge bright silver tail slithering in the heavens above<br>
        It's head turns and the snake looks straight at him.<br>
        It's eyes are bright red, like the flames in their fireplace at home.<br>
        The snake opens it's mouth and it's forklike tongue slithers out and over it's fangs.<br>
        It slithers in front of the sun and suddenly there is no light, only darkness....<br>
        Johnny freezes, he cannot see his hand in front of him.<br>
        Mommy, Mommy ...<br>
        ....<br>
        ......<br>

      </div>
      Apophis, also known as Apep in Egyptian mythology, was the god of Chaos.<br>
      He was the polar opposite of the godly personification 
      of order, Ma'at, and the chief enemy of the king of the gods, 
      the sun-god Ra.<br>
      He took the form of a great snake.<br>
      This egyptian deity embodied darkness and disorder.<br>

    In the year 2029 an astroid will pass by Earth.<br>
    This astroid is more that 300 meters wide (three soccer fields)
    and will be within 31 000 km (approx) as it goes passed us.<br>
    The effect of this astroid going passed our planet's gravitational 
    pull will cause it to violently shake.<br>
    <details>
      <summary>This phenomena is known as <span class="my-p"> 'asteroidquake'</span>.</summary>
    <framed-text>
      <h3>What are asteroid quakes?</h3>
        The theoretical shaking could happen due to gravitational tidal forces, 
        which are the stretching or pulling effect on an object caused by the uneven 
        gravitational pull from another massive body.<br>

    Now what has this got to do with my little story about Johnny?<br>
    Well this astroid is named after that god, namely <strong>Apophis.</strong><br>
