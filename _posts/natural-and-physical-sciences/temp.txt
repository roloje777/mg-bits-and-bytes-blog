Apep, also known as Apophis in Greek, was the Egyptian god of
 chaos. Apep was the polar opposite of the godly personification 
 of order, Ma'at, and the chief enemy of the king of the gods, 
 the sun-god Ra. He took the form of a great snake.

Apep (Ancient Egyptian: ꜥꜣpp), also known as Aphoph (/ə.ˈfɒf/, 
Coptic: Ⲁⲫⲱⲫ, romanized: Aphōph)[1] or Apophis (/ə.ˈpɒ.fɪs/; 
Ancient Greek: Ἄποφις, romanized: Ápophis), is the ancient 
Egyptian deity who embodied darkness and disorder, and was thus
 the opponent of light and Maat (order/truth). Ra was the bringer 
 of light and hence the biggest opposer of Apep.
