> The world is not what it seems......

Below a link where David speaks about this book in which he exposes the rit of the billionaire families that control companies like Mercedes and BMW and which start their empires from the atrocities of the crimes committed during world war 2 .
Such makes, that we idolise today..

Interesting Q@A session in which David explains, among many other questions, how the Nazi party become relevant as a result of the great depression of the 1920s...

Where the power structures of the Nazi still operate today at an organisational level....

Lastly, I wonder if there is any underlying influence or driving motive of the past - the topic above - , and the motive of the Ukraine and Russia war today....

Below an extract of the description of his book on Amazon...."

In 1946, Günther Quandt – patriarch of Germany’s most iconic industrial empire, a dynasty that today controls BMW – was arrested for suspected Nazi collaboration. Quandt claimed that he had been forced to join the party by his arch-rival, propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, and the courts acquitted him. But Quandt lied. And his heirs, and those of other Nazi billionaires, have only grown wealthier in the generations since, while their reckoning with this dark past remains incomplete at best. Many of them continue to control swaths of the world economy, owning iconic brands whose products blanket the globe. The brutal legacy of the dynasties that dominated Daimler-Benz, cofounded Allianz and still control Porsche, Volkswagen and BMW has remained hidden in plain sight – until now.

In this landmark work, investigative journalist David de Jong reveals the true story of how Germany’s wealthiest business dynasties amassed untold money and power by abetting the atrocities of the Third Reich. Using a wealth of untapped sources, de Jong shows how these tycoons seized Jewish businesses, procured slave labourers and ramped up weapons production to equip Hitler’s army as Europe burnt around them. Most shocking of all, de Jong exposes how the wider world’s political expediency enabled these billionaires to get away with their crimes, covering up a bloodstain that defiles the German and global economy to this day.
