> When I mention AEROS don't confuse it with the chocolate Aero.  
> AEROS is a satelite the size of a milk carton that will form a network in space to analise the Earth's oceans.  
> By analysing the oceans colours, one will be able to monitor its health.  
> This was developed by both business and academia in Portugal.  
> This project started in 2020, a 4.5 kilogram nano-satellite will be on board a Falcon 9 rocket in March 2024, being the second portuguese satelite to be launched.  
> The first called PoSat-1 was launched around 30 years ago.  
> One of the partners in the consortium , the CEiiA engineering centre in Matosinhos, will process the data and images for scientific studies.  
> Currently, Portugal has around 50 missions (projects) for the European Space Agency.

> The capsule responsible for the transport and safe return to Earth of the samples collected by the NASA, developed by ISQ, PIEP and Stratosphere (members of AED Cluster Portugal), together with Amorim Cork Composites, is another example of space technologies developed by Portugal.

    One of the most valuable resources we have to protect is the world’s Oceans.<br>
    They have a prominent role in the Earth ecosystem, as they cover most of the Earth’s surface, contain millions of plants and animals, influence global weather, and produce about 70 percent of the oxygen we breathe.<br>
    Oceans are thus essential for technological, scientific, economic, and social development, having enabled exploration and commerce for hundreds of years.<br>
    As Portugal starts to assume a stronger position as a robust space-faring nation, the Consortium looks for the scientific and economic synergies from New Space technologies and opportunities that could be leveraged to prospect, monitor and value the Oceans in a sustainable manner, aligned with both the “Atlantic Interactions” research agenda and the UN Sustainable Development Goals.<br>

    The AEROS Constellation (AEROS) project aimed to develop a nano-satellite platform as a precursor to a future constellation to leverage scientific and economic synergies between space and the ocean.<br>
    The project is made up of a consortium of Portuguese companies, research institutes and universities, which in addition to the University of Minho and MIT involves Edisoft as the consortium leader, DSTelecom, CEiiA, SpinWorks, the University of Porto, the University of Algarve, the Instituto Superior Técnico, the Instituto do Mar, Colab +Atlântico, the AIR Centre and MIT Portugal.<br>
