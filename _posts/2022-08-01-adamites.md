The [Adamites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adamites), or Adamians, were adherents of an Early Christian group in North Africa in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th centuries.  
They wore no clothing during their religious services.  
There were later reports of similar sects in Central Europe during the Late Middle Ages.
