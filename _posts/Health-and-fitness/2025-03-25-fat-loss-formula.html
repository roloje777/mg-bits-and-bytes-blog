                <p>What Does A Healthy Body Really Look Like?</p>
            </div>
            When people say they want to lose fat what they actually are 
            saying is that their goal is to lose that but retain or even
            build muscle, so that they also look good in their outfits and 
            are comfortable in the swimming costume on the beach.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, there's so much wrong information and misconception out
            there about fat loss that it's easy to get hooked on every new "FAD"
            diet  or supplement that promises to get your results in no time.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Most of these, may result in fat loss, but unfortunately also muscle 
            loss and or even hurt your overall health.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            You need to understand what will trigger fat loss in your body from a 
            chemical point of view.<br>
        </p>

        Before I start on this topic, I'd like to state, that if you read to the end of this blog, 
        I'll have not one but two additional surprises for you.<br>

        <h2>What Most People Think The Fat Loss Formula Looks Like</h2>
        <p>
            <span style="font-size:1.5em">Consume Less Calories Than What Your Body Burns = Fat Loss</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            If you provide your body with less energy than it uses on a daily 
            basis, it'll start reducing its fat stores in order to stay alive.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Now this is pretty simple, and this is how 100% of all the "FAD"
            diets work.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>
            Now note that you can diet on pizzas or and chocolate and still
            lose weight, as long as the calories you consume are in deficit.<br>
        </strong>
        <i>Now, by no means do I encourage this type of diet, as its not healthy,
           but I'm just trying to show you the concept of how ones body works.<br></i>

        <h2>So why eat healthy?</h2>
        <p>
        Well, when I started this short blog of mine, I started by stating that when one's goal
        is to lose weight, it actually meant lose weight, <strong>BUT MAINTAIN OR EVEN GAIN MUSCLE.</strong><br>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="https://images-provider.frontiersin.org/api/ipx/w=410&f=webp/https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/960922/fnut-09-960922-HTML/image_m/fnut-09-960922-g001.jpg" alt="What Does A Healthy Body Really Look Like?">

    <blockquote>
        <h2>Is that it?</h2>
        <p>
            oK, So If I eat healthy and maintain a caloric deficit, I'll lose
            weight and not lose muscle.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately <strong>NO</strong>.....<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            There is one more ingredient to this "Weight Loss Formula".<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="https://boulderpondsseniorliving.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/How-Much-Physical-Activity-Do-Older-Adults-Need-Hero-1.jpg" alt="">
                
            </div>
        Even though running a caloric deficit and eating only healthy foods is
        a good start to losing weight, if you don't <strong>exercise</strong>, your body will
        also lose muscle.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Like they say, If You don't use is, you'll lose it..</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            This is not what we want.<br>
            We want our weight loss to be due to less fat in our body while
            keeping our strength and a firm body.<br>

            Now I'll share with you the secret <strong>Fat Loss Formula</strong>.<br><br>
            Shhhh don't tell anyone, .. it's our secret and it's pretty simple....<br><br>
            So what is this secret?...<br>

        <p>
            <ul>
                There are three things you need to keep in mind when
                wanting to lose fat. <br>
                <li>first you need to eat less calories than your body expends.</li>
                <li>Second, your diet should consist of a certain percentage of
                    carbs, fats and protein.</li>
                <li>And third, make sure to exercise to not lose any muscle.</li>

        <h2>The Bonus</h2>
        <p>
            Since you made it to this point I've decided to give you additional information.<br>            
        </p>
        <p>
            By now you've figured out that to lose weight one needs to be in a calory deficit, 
            thus it’s only logical that to build bigger muscles one needs to be in a calory surplus.<br>            
        </p>
        <h3>Can One Lose Fat While Gaining Muscle?</h3>
        <p>
            Well, the basic answer is <strong>No</strong>.<br>       
        </p>
        <p>
            In theory, it's almost impossible to be doing both at the same time.<br>
            This is due to the fact that our body needs the extra energy for a process called protein synthesis.<br>
            Only at a caloric surplus will it be able to repair the muscle fibers that were damaged during your training.<br>
            <ul>
                This is why most athletes and bodybuilders work in two phases.
                <li>                    
                    You add as much strength and size while eating at a caloric surplus.<br>
                    This is called the Bulking phase.
                </li>
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="https://www.ninjaquestfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Arnold-eating.jpg">
                        <p>During Bulking Phase Body Builders can eat up to 5000 calories in a day</p>
                    </div>
                <li>
                    And then you change to a calorie deficit where you try to maintain as much muscle as possible while losing fat.<br>
                    This is called cutting phase<br>
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="https://fitbod.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Differences-Between-A-Clean-Bulk-and-A-Dirty-Bulk.jpg">
                     </div>
                </li>
            </ul>            
        </p>
        <h3>There Is Some Good News?</h3>
        <p>
            The above applies for experienced athletes.<br>
            If you are a beginner, the answer is <strong>YES</strong>.<br>
            This is because a beginner athlete's muscles are still adapting , and as a result this adaption
            outweighs the problems with protein synthesis and caloric deficit.<br>

        <h2>Bonus No 2</h2>
        <p>
            Wow, you've read all the way until here, I'm impressed.<br>
            You must be serious about your health  and physical appearance.<br>
            So I'm going to give you one more tip, to help you on the road to a better <strong>You</strong>.<br>            
            <ul>
                Here I'm going to speak briefly about some <strong>Myths</strong> out there.<br>
                <li><strong>The Spot Reduction Myth</strong><br>
                    Many people believe that fat loss can be localized to a certain region of your body.<br>
                    They believe that by doing crunches one will make them lose fat around their belly and and doing 
                    triceps extension will eliminate the flab under one's arms.<br>
                    <strong>This is not so.</strong><br>
                   <strong>Fat loss always occurs in your entire body and not only in specific regions.</strong> <br>
                    Now, you may find that some people may lose quicker, say around their stomach 
                    and another say around their arms, but this has to do with genetics and not the exercises.<br>
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="https://keepfitkingdom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/The-Myth-of-Spot-Reduction-Keep-Fit-Kingdom-842x472.jpg">
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li><strong>More Cardio, more Fat Loss</strong><br>
                    This one is a Half Truth.<br>
                    It is true that the more cardio you do, the more energy you use and thus the potential
                    to lose weight is there.<br>
                    The issue here is, that if one does cardio, or for that sake of it any other form of exercise
                    and you replace those used calories, then you have not lost any weight.<br>
                    In fact, many people will <strong>over eat</strong> and actually put on weight.<br>
                    They key is <strong>Caloric deficit</strong><br>
                    <strong>What it really comes down to is not how much cardio you do, but calories in versus calories out.</strong>
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="https://jpimg.com.br/uploads/2025/01/7-beneficios-da-pratica-de-cardio-para-a-saude.jpg">
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Higher Reps Will Get You Ripped</strong><br>
                        This one, unfortunately is also <strong>False</strong>.<br>
                        Muscle definition has nothing to do with the number of repetitions and everything with your body fat percentage.<br>
                        If you want to look right, you'll have to lose fat.<br>
