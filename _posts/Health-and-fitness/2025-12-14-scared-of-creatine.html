  <h2>Introduction: A Conversation That Started at the Breakfast Table</h2>
  <p>Creatine is one of the most researched supplements in the world — and yet, for many people, it still raises questions, doubts, and quiet concerns. This blog didn’t 
    start in a lab or a gym. It started at home, over breakfast, coffee, and everyday conversations with my wife, Elvira. Through real moments, honest questions, and 
    science-backed answers, this article explores what creatine really is, who it’s for, how to use it safely, and why context matters. Whether you’re young or older, active or 
    simply health-conscious, my goal is simple: to replace confusion with clarity, and fear with understanding.</p>



<h2>Morning Conversation: Creatine for Adults Over 50</h2>

     style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
    </div>

    <blockquote>



        <p>The light slips quietly through the shutters in my bedroom. It's early morning. Stillness. The kind of silence you only notice when you’re not rushing anywhere.</p>

        <p>I’m 61 now. Elvira is in her mid-fifties. Mornings are slower than they used to be — intentional, calm, deliberate.</p>

        <p>She’s already awake, staring at the ceiling.</p>

        <p>“You didn’t sleep?” I ask.</p>

        <p>“Not really,” she says, smiling slightly. “I was thinking about that white powder again.”</p>

        <p>I laugh. “The creatine?”</p>

        <p>She nods. “I know you keep saying it’s safe, but I don’t really <em>understand</em> it. And at our age, I just want to be careful.”</p>

        <p>“That’s exactly why I’m comfortable with it,” I say. “I’m a CPD-certified health, wellness and fitness coach — and I don’t recommend supplements lightly. Creatine isn’t a trend. It’s one of the most studied supplements we have, especially in people our age.”</p>

        <p>She looks at me, listening.</p>

        <p>“There are studies with <strong>hundreds of participants</strong>, including men and women over 50, showing improvements in strength, muscle preservation, and functional health — especially when creatine is combined with resistance training. No crazy doses. No extreme athletes. Just normal adults trying to stay strong and independent.”</p>

        <p>“So it’s not just for gym bros,” she says.</p>

        <p>“Exactly. And your body already makes it. Right now. Creatine is produced from amino acids and stored mainly in your muscles and brain. It helps your cells produce energy when you need it quickly — standing up, climbing stairs, lifting groceries, or training.”</p>

        <p>We get out of bed and walk into the kitchen. The floor is cold. The kettle clicks on.</p>

        <p>I start making breakfast — oats in the bowl, egg whites, two whole eggs, a splash of protein-enriched milk, a tablespoon of butter, a drizzle of honey. Finally, I add <strong>3.5 grams of creatine</strong>, stirring it in without ceremony.</p>

        <p>Elvira watches. “That’s it? Just mixed in?”</p>

        <p>“That’s it,” I say. “No magic. Just consistency.”</p>

        <p>She pauses, then smiles. “Alright. But later, you explain it properly. With actual science.”</p>

        <p>I smile back and think to myself.  “I must write a blog on this”</p>
    </blockquote>

<h2>What Is Creatine and How Does It Work?</h2>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1693996045435-af7c48b9cafb?q=80&w=2070&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D"
            alt="A container of creatine with its Molecular Structure on the label" >
         </div>

<p>Creatine is a naturally occurring compound found in the human body. It’s not a drug, a hormone, or a stimulant. It’s made from amino acids and plays a very simple, very important role: <strong>helping cells produce energy quickly</strong>.</p>

<p>About 95% of the creatine in your body is stored in skeletal muscle, with the rest in the brain and other tissues. There, it exists mostly as <em>phosphocreatine</em>, a form that acts like an energy reserve. When your body needs energy fast — standing up from a chair, lifting something heavy, sprinting, or pushing through a strength set — phosphocreatine helps regenerate ATP, the molecule that powers muscle contraction.</p>

<p>In practical terms, creatine doesn’t make you “strong out of nowhere.” It helps you <strong>do a little more of what you’re already doing</strong> — one extra rep, slightly better recovery, or a bit more power when it counts.</p>

<p>This is why creatine appears consistently in research on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strength and power training</li>
<li>Muscle preservation with aging</li>
<li>Short, high-intensity efforts</li>
<li>Functional performance in older adults</li>
</ul>



<h3>How the Body Naturally Produces Creatine</h3>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="https://www.creative-proteomics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/creatinine-and-metabolomics-in-health-1.jpg"
            alt="An image of our liver and kidneys in creatine production" >
    </div>

<p>Your body already knows what to do with creatine. It’s produced naturally from three amino acids: <strong>arginine, glycine, and methionine</strong>, mainly in the kidneys, liver, and pancreas. Once produced, creatine enters the bloodstream and is transported to tissues with high energy demand — especially muscles and brain.</p>

<p>Every day, your body:</p>
<ul>
<li>Produces creatine</li>
<li>Uses creatine</li>
<li>Breaks down a small amount into creatinine, which is excreted in urine</li>
</ul>

<p>As we age, several things can reduce available creatine:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lower dietary intake (especially if meat/fish intake is reduced)</li>
<li>Age-related muscle loss</li>
<li>Reduced physical activity</li>
<li>Less efficient storage in muscle tissue</li>
</ul>

<p>Supplementing with creatine simply <strong>tops up existing stores</strong>, allowing muscles to maintain a higher level of readily available energy — without overriding your natural system.</p>

<h2>Creatine After 50: Maintaining Strength, Muscle, and Function</h2>
   <div class="image-container">
        <img src="https://media.gettyimages.com/id/1014371994/pt/vetorial/exercises-for-the-elderly.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=1cpZbii95DWWajoT50B0d73nIejJWutrMlO6a-vn308="
            alt="An image of elderly couple exercising" >
    </div>

<p>After 50, most people slowly lose muscle mass and strength — a process called sarcopenia. This affects balance, independence, and overall quality of life.</p>

<p>Research involving men and women in their 50s, 60s, and beyond shows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resistance training is still the most important factor for maintaining strength</li>
<li>Creatine combined with resistance training improves muscle mass and strength more than training alone</li>
<li>Functional outcomes — like chair stands, walking speed, and overall capacity — often improve with creatine supplementation</li>
</ul>

<p>For this age group, creatine is about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preserving muscle</li>
<li>Supporting strength</li>
<li>Improving training quality</li>
<li>Maintaining independence</li>
</ul>

<p>Typical doses in studies are modest — usually <strong>3–5 grams per day</strong> — and safety in healthy older adults is strong.</p>



<h2>Addressing Common Concerns: Is Creatine Safe During a Cold or Illness?</h2>
   <div class="image-container">
        <img src="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/vector-illustration-woman-spoon-her-260nw-2286244057.jpg"
            alt="An image of a lady eating porridge" >
    </div>

    <blockquote>

        <p>As I spoon oats into bowls, Elvira frowns slightly. “João… I also read somewhere that if you have a cold or something like that, creatine might not be safe. Is that true?”</p>

        <p>I put down the spoon and look at her. “Ah, that’s a common worry, but let’s break it down.”</p>

        <p>“Creatine is naturally produced by your body, and your muscles and cells use it for energy. It’s not a medicine, it’s not a drug, and it doesn’t suppress your immune system. So, having a common cold or mild flu doesn’t make creatine dangerous.”</p>

        <p>Elvira leans back, still listening. “So I could technically keep taking it?”</p>

        <p>“Yes, in most cases, it’s fine. The only time you might want to pause,” I explain, “is if you’re severely dehydrated, vomiting, or have a serious illness that affects your kidneys. That’s because creatine pulls water into your muscles, and in extreme situations, your body needs all the hydration it can get elsewhere.”</p>

        <p>She nods thoughtfully. “Okay, that makes sense. So for a mild cold, I don’t need to stop?”</p>

        <p>“Exactly,” I say with a reassuring smile. “Just make sure you’re staying hydrated, getting your rest, and focusing on recovery. Creatine doesn’t make a common cold worse, and the benefits you’ve been reading about for strength and muscle preservation still apply once you’re feeling better.”</p>

        <p>Elvira relaxes, sipping her coffee. “Alright… that eases my mind. It’s good to know it’s generally safe, even when I’m under the weather.”</p>

        <p>I nod. “Exactly. Knowledge makes it less scary.”</p>

        <p>I watch her smile, thinking quietly to myself: <em>Note to self — must add a section on the myths of creatine so people like Elvira don’t get 
            worried about false information.</em></p>

<h2>Lunchtime Questions: If We Eat Meat, Why Supplement Creatine?</h2>
   <div class="image-container">
        <img src="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/elderly-man-enjoying-nutritious-salad-260nw-2660445257.jpg"
            alt="An image of an elderly man have lunch" 
            style="height:0%;width:auto" >
    </div>
    <blockquote>

        <p>Later that day, we’re sitting down for lunch. Nothing fancy. Grilled chicken breasts, some brown rice, a simple tomato salad with olive oil and salt. Water in tall glasses. Sunlight coming through the window.</p>

        <p>It’s the kind of meal we’ve eaten for years — balanced, familiar, nourishing.</p>

        <p>Elvira takes a bite, then looks up. “Can I ask another question?”</p>

        <p>I smile. “Of course.”</p>

        <p>“If creatine comes from meat,” she says, gesturing lightly with her fork, “and we eat chicken, fish, eggs… why do we even need to supplement it?”</p>

        <p>“That’s actually a very good question,” I say. “And one a lot of people don’t think to ask.”</p>

        <p>I take a sip of water before continuing. “Yes, we do get creatine from food — mainly from red meat and fish. Chicken has some, but not as much. To put it in perspective, you’d need to eat roughly half a kilo of red meat every single day just to get around 3 to 5 grams of creatine.”</p>

        <p>Her eyebrows lift slightly. “That’s a lot of meat.”</p>

        <p>“Exactly,” I nod. “And most people — especially as they get older — don’t want or need to eat that much. Supplementing just makes it easier to reach the levels used in studies without overloading the diet.”</p>

        <p>She thinks for a moment. “So it’s not replacing food. It’s just… topping things up.”</p>

        <p>“That’s the perfect way to put it,” I say. “Supplementation increases muscle creatine stores beyond what diet alone usually provides. That’s why research consistently shows benefits even in people who already eat animal products.”</p>

        <p>She nods slowly. “And I suppose for vegetarians…”</p>

        <p>“And vegans especially,” I add. “They tend to have lower baseline creatine levels because plant foods don’t contain creatine. Interestingly, studies often show that vegetarians and vegans respond even more strongly to creatine supplementation, simply because they’re starting from lower levels.”</p>

        <p>“So for them, it’s even more useful,” she says.</p>

        <p>“Yes,” I reply. “But whether you eat meat or not, the goal is the same — supporting muscle, strength, and energy production, especially as we age.”</p>

        <p>We finish lunch quietly. Plates cleared. Dishes rinsed.</p>

        <p>I pour two small cups of <strong>bica</strong> — strong Portuguese espresso. We sit back, sipping slowly.</p>

        <p>Elvira smiles. “Alright. That one makes sense too.”</p>

        <p>I take a sip, thinking to myself how often simple, honest questions lead to the most important explanations.</p>

<h3>Common Food Sources of Creatine</h3>

            alt="An image of steak on a plate ready to eat" >
    </div>

    <blockquote>

        <p>Elvira takes another sip of her bica, then tilts her head slightly. “So… which foods actually have the most creatine?”</p>

        <p>“Mainly animal-based foods,” I reply. “Creatine is stored in muscle, so foods that come from muscle tissue contain the most.”</p>

        <p>I start listing them off, almost instinctively. “Red meat is at the top — beef and lamb in particular. Then oily fish like herring, salmon, and tuna. Pork has a fair amount too. Chicken and turkey contain some, but less.”</p>

        <p>“And eggs?” she asks.</p>

        <p>“Very little,” I say. “Eggs are fantastic for protein and micronutrients, but they’re not a meaningful source of creatine. Same with dairy — milk and cheese don’t really contribute much either.”</p>

        <p>She nods. “So if someone doesn’t eat red meat or fish…”</p>

        <p>“Then their dietary creatine intake is quite low,” I finish the sentence. “That’s why vegetarians and vegans typically have lower muscle creatine stores. It’s not a problem in itself, but it does explain why supplementation can be especially helpful for them.”</p>

        <p>I pause, then add, “Even for meat eaters like us, you’d still need fairly large portions — day after day — to match what a simple 3–5 gram supplement provides. And that’s not always practical or desirable.”</p>

        <p>Elvira smiles. “So food first, but supplements fill the gap.”</p>

        <p>“Exactly,” I say. “Supplements don’t replace a good diet — they support it.”</p>

   <h2>The Next Morning: Breakfast, BICA, and One More Question About Coffee</h2>
         <div class="image-container">

            alt="An image of a six moth old black kitten" >
    </div>

         <blockquote>                

                <p>It’s the next morning. As usual, I’m the first one up.</p>

                <p>The kitchen is quiet as I prepare breakfast — <strong>Nestum Pro</strong>, whipped pasteurised egg whites, protein-enriched milk, and half a mashed banana in each bowl.
                   Before serving, I add <strong>3.5 grams of creatine</strong> to our bowls of porridge, stirring it in until it disappears completely.</p>

                <p>Simple, warm, comforting. Roughly <strong>45 grams of protein</strong> to start the day.</p>

                <p>We sit down, finish eating, and end — as we often do — with a <strong>bica</strong>.</p>

                <p>Right on cue, a small pitch-black blur appears.</p>

                <p><strong>BICA</strong> — the most recent addition to our family — launches himself onto the table. Six months old. Shiny eyes. Far too curious for his own good.</p>

                <p>We named him after our favourite coffee. It seemed fitting.</p>

                <p>Elvira laughs. “He’s at that naughty stage now.”</p>
                <p>I look at him and can’t help but smile. Six months ago, Nicole — a teacher at a private school where she teaches English — found him abandoned near a garbage bin while 
                  walking home from her last lesson.Umbilical cord still attached. We honestly didn’t think he’d survive.</p>

                 <p>And yet — here he was.</p>

                <p>Elvira sips her coffee and starts planning lunch out loud. “Tuna, boiled potatoes, a drizzle of olive oil.”</p>

                <p>“Perfect,” I say. “High protein, good carbs, healthy fats. Simple and very Mediterranean.”</p>

                <p>She nods. “After lunch I need to book Nicole’s hairdresser appointment… and we have to stop by the vet. It’s time to get BICA spayed.”</p>

                <p>She takes another sip of coffee, staring into the cup for a moment.</p>

                <p>“João,” she says thoughtfully, “what about caffeine and creatine?”</p>

                <p>I smile. “There it is.”</p>

                <p>“The short answer,” I say, “is that caffeine doesn’t cancel creatine.”</p>

                <p>“Creatine works by building up stores in the muscle over time. Coffee works quickly on the nervous system. Different pathways. Different timelines.”</p>

                <p>She looks relieved. “So my coffee isn’t ruining anything.”</p>

                <p>“No,” I say. “But there are a few practical things worth knowing.”</p>

                <p>“Some people may experience mild stomach discomfort if they take large amounts of caffeine and creatine together, especially on an empty stomach. That’s more about digestion than effectiveness.”</p>

                <p>“Which is why,” I add, “taking creatine with food — like breakfast — tends to work well for most people.”</p>

                <p>She smiles. “So again… moderation and common sense.”</p>

                <p>I nod. “As always.”</p>

   <h2>At the Pastelaria: Creatine for Younger People, Sports, Dosage — and Timing</h2>

<div class="image-container">

</div>

<blockquote>

    <p>A couple of days later, we’re sitting at our local <em>pastelaria</em>. The familiar hum of conversation, cups clinking, the smell of fresh coffee. Two galões on the table and a pastel de nata between us — shared, as always.</p>

    <p>Elvira stirs her coffee slowly. “Okay,” she says, smiling, “we’ve talked a lot about us. But what about younger people?”</p>

    <p>I raise an eyebrow. “What do you mean?”</p>

    <p>“Well,” she continues, “creatine is always associated with gyms and athletes. What are the benefits for younger people? And does it depend on the sport?”</p>

    <p>I nod. “It does — but maybe not in the way most people think.”</p>

    <p>“For younger adults,” I explain, “creatine mainly supports performance in activities that rely on short bursts of effort — resistance training, sprinting, football, rugby, tennis, CrossFit, and many team sports. Basically anything involving strength, power, or repeated high-intensity efforts.”</p>

    <p>She leans in slightly. “So not just bodybuilders.”</p>

    <p>“Not at all,” I say. “Bodybuilders benefit because they train hard and often. But creatine has been studied across a wide range of sports — endurance athletes, cyclists, swimmers, even recreational exercisers.”</p>

    <p>“The benefits are often indirect,” I add. “Better training quality, faster recovery between efforts, and over time, improvements in strength or lean mass.”</p>

    <p>She pauses. “And how young is too young?”</p>

    <p>“That’s an important question,” I reply. “Most research focuses on adults, usually 18 and over. Creatine has been studied in adolescents in clinical and sports settings, but generally, supplementation should be reserved for adults or older teenagers who are training seriously, eating properly, and ideally have guidance from a qualified professional.”</p>

    <p>She nods. “So not something a twelve-year-old needs.”</p>

    <p>I smile. “Exactly. Food, movement, and sleep come first.”</p>

    <p>She takes a sip of coffee. “And what about dosage? Is it different for different sports?”</p>

    <p>“Interestingly,” I say, “the dosage is very consistent across most sports. For the majority of people, <strong>3 to 5 grams per day</strong> is enough — regardless of age or activity.”</p>

    <p>“No loading phases?” she asks.</p>

    <p>“They exist,” I say, “but they’re optional. A loading phase — usually around 20 grams per day for five to seven days — just fills muscle stores faster. Taking 3–5 grams daily gets you to the same place over a few weeks, with less risk of stomach discomfort.”</p>

    <p>She nods. “So slow and steady again.”</p>

    <p>“Exactly,” I smile. “Especially for people training for health rather than competition.”</p>

    <p>She hesitates, then adds, “And what about timing? Morning, night, before training, after?”</p>

    <p>I laugh softly. “That’s another one people love to overcomplicate.”</p>

    <p>“Creatine doesn’t work like caffeine,” I explain. “It works by gradually building up muscle stores over time. Because of that, <strong>the most important factor is taking it consistently — not the exact time of day</strong>.”</p>

    <p>“So breakfast works,” she says.</p>

    <p>“Perfectly,” I reply. “Taking creatine with food — especially with protein and carbohydrates — can help with tolerance and absorption. That’s why breakfast is a practical choice for many people.”</p>

    <p>“And for bodybuilders?” she asks.</p>

    <p>“For people focused on muscle growth and strength,” I say, “some evidence suggests taking creatine close to training — often post-workout — may offer a small additional benefit. But it’s a minor difference. Total daily intake and consistency matter far more.”</p>

    <p>She smiles. “So the best time is…”</p>

    <p>“…the time you’ll actually remember to take it,” I finish.</p>

    <p>She laughs. “Simple again.”</p>

    <p>“That seems to be the pattern,” I say. “Creatine works across ages and sports, but it’s not magic. It supports good training and good habits — it doesn’t replace them.”</p>

    <p>We finish our coffees quietly, watching people come and go, both of us thinking how often clear information cuts through unnecessary fear.</p>

<blockquote>

    <p>Still sitting at the pastelaria, Elvira glances at her phone. “Next week we’ll go to Mirandela to pick up Nicole,” she says. “We can do the Christmas shopping while we’re there.”</p>

    <p>I nod, already picturing it — family time, slower mornings, good food.</p>

    <p>A few days later, the three of us are sitting at a café overlooking the river. Morning light reflects off the water, coffee steaming gently in our hands. Breakfast is simple — toast, eggs, fruit — the kind of meal that invites conversation.</p>

    <p>Elvira is mid-sentence, enthusiastically explaining creatine to Nicole. “It’s actually one of the most researched supplements there is,” she says. “Not just for athletes — even for muscle health as we get older.”</p>

    <p>I drift off for a moment, watching the river, half-smiling to myself.</p>

    <p>“Dad?”</p>

    <p>Nicole pulls me back. “One of my friends is pregnant,” she says. “She still goes to the gym, which I think is good… but I’m not sure about supplements. I think she’s still taking creatine. Isn’t that dangerous?”</p>

    <p>I pause — not because the question is difficult, but because it deserves care.</p>

    <p>“That’s a very good question,” I say. “And it’s one of the few situations where the answer isn’t black and white.”</p>

    <p>“Staying active during pregnancy is generally healthy,” I continue. “Strength training and exercise — when appropriately adapted — can be beneficial. But supplementation is a different conversation.”</p>

    <p>Elvira listens quietly now.</p>

    <p>“Creatine is naturally produced by the body,” I explain, “and it’s found in food. However, when it comes to pregnancy, we have to be honest: there isn’t enough high-quality research yet to confidently recommend creatine supplementation during pregnancy.”</p>

    <p>Nicole nods slowly. “So it’s not that it’s proven dangerous…”</p>

    <p>“Correct,” I say. “But it also hasn’t been proven safe in that context. And during pregnancy, that matters.”</p>

    <p>She thinks for a moment, then adds, “What about after the baby is born — during breastfeeding?”</p>

    <p>“Another important question,” I say. “The situation is very similar. While creatine is a natural compound, <strong>there isn’t enough solid research on creatine supplementation during breastfeeding</strong> — particularly regarding how much may pass into breast milk and its potential effects on the infant.”</p>

    <p>Elvira frowns slightly. “So the advice stays the same?”</p>

    <p>“Yes,” I reply. “During breastfeeding, the safest approach is to prioritise food — adequate protein, sufficient calories, good hydration — and to avoid non-essential supplements unless specifically recommended by a doctor or healthcare professional.”</p>

    <p>“So exercise — yes,” Elvira says softly. “Creatine — probably not.”</p>

    <p>“Exactly,” I smile. “Pregnancy and breastfeeding aren’t the time for experimentation. The basics — good nutrition, movement, and rest — are more than enough.”</p>

    <p>Nicole exhales, visibly relieved. “That actually makes a lot of sense.”</p>

    <p>I take a sip of coffee and look back out at the river, thinking how the same supplement can be perfectly appropriate at one stage of life and unnecessary — or ill-advised — at another.</p>

    <p>Context, as always, is everything.</p>

   <h2>An Evening at Home: Will Creatine Make Me Gain Weight or Look Too Muscular?</h2>

    <div class="image-container">

            alt="Illustration showing common myths about creatine, including weight gain and excessive muscle growth">
    </div>

  <blockquote>

    <p>It’s a quiet evening at home. Dinner is done, the dishes are cleared, and we’re sitting at the kitchen table with tea instead of coffee.</p>

    <p>I’m scrolling through my phone, half distracted, reading a news article about how <strong>the comet 3I/Atlas, an interstellar object</strong> is approaching Earth. Scientists say there’s no immediate danger, but I find myself lingering on the details — trajectories, distances, probabilities.</p>

    <p>For a moment, I’m deep in thought, contemplating how something so vast and distant can quietly capture our attention, simply because we don’t fully understand it.</p>

    <p>Elvira looks up at me.</p>


    <p>“João,” she says, “a friend told me something else about creatine today.”</p>

    <p>I put the phone down. “Go on.”</p>

    <p>“She said that if I take it, I’ll put on weight… and start looking muscular.” She wrinkles her nose slightly. “You know I don’t want that.”</p>

    <p>I smile gently. “That’s probably one of the most common myths about creatine.”</p>

    <p>“First,” I say, “creatine doesn’t magically build muscle. Muscle comes from resistance training, effort, and time. Creatine simply helps your muscles produce energy more efficiently during that training.”</p>

    <p>She listens carefully.</p>

    <p>“As for weight,” I continue, “some people notice a small increase on the scale when they first start. That’s usually water being stored inside the muscle cells — not fat. It’s actually a sign that the muscle is better hydrated and functioning well.”</p>

    <p>“So it’s not fat gain?” she asks.</p>

    <p>“No,” I say firmly. “Creatine does not increase body fat. Large studies consistently show this. And it won’t make you ‘bulky’ unless you’re training very specifically for muscle size — which you’re not.”</p>

    <p>She laughs softly. “Definitely not.”</p>

    <p>“For most women,” I add, “creatine supports strength, bone health, and muscle preservation. It helps you stay capable — not muscular in a way you don’t want.”</p>

    <p>She exhales. “So I won’t wake up looking like a bodybuilder?”</p>

    <p>“Only if you secretly start training like one,” I laugh.</p>

    <p>She smiles. “Alright. That myth can definitely go on the list.”</p>

<h3>What About Overdosing on Creatine?</h3>
  <div class="image-container">
        <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xLSz3wEgwJ8/maxresdefault.jpg"
            alt="Image of a person lying down,All one sees is an out stretched arm and a syringe. There is a watermark with the words overdose">
    </div>
  <blockquote>

    <p>Elvira pauses for a moment, then asks one more question.</p>

     <p>“But what if someone takes too much? Can you overdose on creatine?”</p>

    <p>“That’s an important point,” I say. “Creatine isn’t dangerous, but more is not better.”</p>

    <p>I explain that the body has a <strong>limited capacity to store creatine</strong>. Once muscle stores are saturated, extra creatine doesn’t provide additional benefits — it’s simply excreted as creatinine in urine.</p>

    <p>“Taking very high doses — especially for long periods — can increase the chance of gastrointestinal discomfort like bloating, cramping, or diarrhoea,” I continue. “And while studies consistently show creatine is safe for healthy individuals, there’s no advantage to exceeding recommended doses.”</p>

    <p>Research-backed guidelines consistently show that:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>3–5 grams per day</strong> is sufficient for long-term use</li>
        <li>Optional loading phases should be short and followed by maintenance dosing</li>
        <li>Chronic high-dose intake offers no added benefit and may increase side effects</li>
    </ul>

    <p>“So the safest approach,” I conclude, “is also the simplest one — modest daily dosing, good hydration, and consistency.”</p>

    <p>Elvira nods. “So again… common sense.”</p>

    <p>I smile. “Creatine seems to reward that.”</p>

  <h2>Through the Mountains of Bornes: Creatine and Hair Loss</h2>

<div class="image-container">

         alt="Scenic view of the Serra de Bornes in Trás-os-Montes">
</div>

<blockquote>

    <p>We drive past Sambade, the road beginning to climb as we head up into the Serra de Bornes. The mountains of Trás-os-Montes rise around us — rugged, quiet, and expansive. Pine and oak trees line the slopes, the late light catching the curves of the hills. It’s one of those drives that naturally slows your thoughts.</p>

    <p>We’re on our way to Mirandela — to pick up our daughter and do our Christmas shopping — when I notice Elvira adjusting her hair in the mirror. She looks thoughtful. Slightly worried.</p>

    <p>“Can I ask you something?” she says.</p>

    <p>“Of course.”</p>

    <p>“I’ve heard people say that creatine causes hair loss,” she says. “Is that actually true?”</p>

    <p>I glance back at the road, the mountains opening up ahead of us.</p>

    <p>“That’s a very common concern,” I reply. “And the short answer is: there’s no good evidence that creatine causes hair loss.”</p>

    <p>She raises an eyebrow. “But where does the idea come from then?”</p>

    <p>“From a single small study done years ago,” I explain. “It showed a temporary increase in a hormone called DHT in young male rugby players. DHT is associated with male-pattern baldness — but the study didn’t measure hair loss itself, only hormone levels. And it’s never been convincingly replicated.”</p>

    <p>She nods slowly. “So higher DHT doesn’t automatically mean hair loss?”</p>

    <p>“Exactly,” I say. “Hair loss depends largely on genetics and individual sensitivity of hair follicles to DHT. If creatine directly caused hair loss, we’d have seen clear evidence by now — it’s one of the most widely used and studied supplements in the world.”</p>

    <p>“And for women?” she asks.</p>

    <p>“Even less reason for concern,” I reply. “Female-pattern hair loss follows different mechanisms, and studies in women haven’t shown creatine to affect hair health or cause shedding. If someone notices hair thinning while taking creatine, it’s far more likely due to stress, hormonal changes, nutrition, or unrelated life factors.”</p>

    <p>She relaxes slightly, smoothing her hair again.</p>

    <p>“So it’s another myth,” she says.</p>

    <p>“Pretty much,” I smile. “Creatine supports energy inside muscle cells. It doesn’t target hair follicles. And for people who are genetically predisposed to hair loss, creatine hasn’t been shown to accelerate or trigger it.”</p>

    <p>The road curves gently as we continue through the mountains, the view opening out over valleys and distant ridgelines.</p>

    <p>“Good,” she says softly. “I quite like my hair.”</p>

    <p>I laugh. “That makes two of us.”</p>

    <p>As we descend toward Mirandela, it strikes me again how often health fears take hold not because of evidence, but because of half-told stories. Sometimes, all it takes is a calm conversation — and a beautiful drive through the mountains — to put them back into perspective.</p>

        <p>A few days later, we’re back in the kitchen. Same place. Same light. Coffee mugs in hand.</p>

        <p>Elvira has my blog open on her <strong>Samsung Android phone</strong>. “So… I read it.”</p>

        <p>“And?” I ask.</p>

        <p>“It’s funny,” she laughs. “When you actually understand <em>what</em> something is, it stops being scary.”</p>

        <p>She scrolls back up. “So creatine isn’t forcing the body to do anything unnatural. It’s just helping with energy where it’s already needed.”</p>

        <p>“Exactly,” I say.</p>

        <p>“And the doses are small. And the studies weren’t just done on twenty-year-old athletes.”</p>

        <p>“No,” I smile. “A lot of them were done on people like us.”</p>

        <p>She pauses. “So the real question isn’t ‘Should I be afraid of creatine?’”</p>

        <p>I nod. “It’s ‘Does this support the life I want to keep living?’”</p>

        <p>She closes the phone. “I think I’m okay with the white powder now.”</p>

        <p>I laugh, spooning oats into a bowl — egg whites, two whole eggs, protein-enriched milk, butter, honey, and <strong>3–5 grams of creatine</strong>. No drama. No hype. Just informed choices, made calmly. And honestly, that’s what good health should feel like.</p>

   <h2>Common Myths About Creatine (And the Facts)</h2>
        <div class="image-container">
                <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/pv-target-images/acbd50d39dfcb49fcc1ff8292a27a04f884a14416f7f53f3eee2100ed2e4282d.jpg"
                    alt="An image of  the mythbusters" >
            </div>



        <h3>Myth 1: Creatine Is Only for Bodybuilders or Young Athletes</h3>
        <p>
        Creatine is often associated with bodybuilding, but research shows benefits across many populations — including older adults, recreational exercisers, team-sport athletes, endurance athletes, and people focused on health and functional fitness. Creatine supports energy production, not a specific body type.
        </p>

        <h3>Myth 2: Creatine Is a Steroid</h3>
        <p>
        Creatine is not a steroid. It is a naturally occurring compound made from amino acids and produced by the body every day. It is found in foods like meat and fish and has no hormonal effects.
        </p>

        <h3>Myth 3: Creatine Damages the Kidneys</h3>
        <p>
        In healthy individuals, creatine has consistently been shown to be safe, even when used long-term. Large-scale reviews and position stands from respected scientific bodies have found no evidence of kidney damage in people without pre-existing kidney disease.
        </p>

        <h3>Myth 4: Creatine Causes Dehydration or Muscle Cramps</h3>
        <p>
        This myth likely comes from early misunderstandings. In reality, creatine draws water into muscle cells, improving hydration at the cellular level. Studies show no increased risk of cramps or dehydration when normal fluid intake is maintained.
        </p>

        <h3>Myth 5: Women Shouldn’t Take Creatine</h3>
        <p>
        Creatine does not cause women to become bulky or overly muscular. Women generally benefit from improved strength, muscle preservation, and exercise tolerance. Creatine supports function and health — not unwanted muscle size.
        </p>

        <h3>Myth 6: Creatine Will Make You Gain Fat or Put on Weight</h3>
        <p>
        Creatine does not increase body fat. Any small increase in body weight some people experience is typically due to increased water content inside muscle cells, not fat gain. This effect is often temporary and reflects improved muscle hydration.
        </p>

        <h3>Myth 7: Creatine Is Unsafe to Take When You Have a Cold or Flu</h3>
        <p>
        Creatine does not suppress the immune system and is generally safe to continue during mild illnesses such as a cold. However, during periods of severe illness, dehydration, or gastrointestinal distress, it may be sensible to pause supplementation until normal hydration and recovery return.
        </p>

        <h3>Myth 8: If You Eat Meat, You Don’t Need Creatine</h3>
        <p>
        While meat and fish contain creatine, it is difficult to reach the levels used in research studies through diet alone without consuming very large amounts daily. Supplementation allows muscle creatine stores to be increased efficiently without excessive food intake.
        </p>

        <h3>Myth 9: Creatine Is Only Useful for Short, Explosive Sports</h3>
        <p>
        While creatine is especially beneficial for strength and power activities, it can also support endurance athletes by improving training quality, recovery between efforts, and overall work capacity.
        </p>

        <h3>Myth 10: You Need a Loading Phase for Creatine to Work</h3>
        <p>
        Loading phases are optional. Taking 3–5 grams per day will gradually saturate muscle creatine stores over time. For most people focused on health and long-term consistency, a daily low-dose approach is perfectly effective.
        </p>

<h2>Creatine at a Glance</h2>

    <ul>
    <li><strong>What it is:</strong> A naturally occurring compound involved in energy production</li>
    <li><strong>Produced by the body:</strong> Yes (liver, kidneys, pancreas)</li>
    <li><strong>Also found in food:</strong> Mainly red meat and fish</li>
    <li><strong>Main benefits:</strong> Strength, power, muscle preservation, training quality</li>
    <li><strong>Who benefits:</strong> Young adults, older adults, athletes, vegetarians, vegans</li>
    <li><strong>Typical dose:</strong> 3–5 grams per day</li>
    <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Any time of day; consistency matters more than timing</li>
    <li><strong>Safety:</strong> One of the most researched supplements available</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Foods and Habits to Be Mindful Of When Taking Creatine</h3>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Very high caffeine intake:</strong> Moderate coffee intake is fine, but excessive caffeine may increase the chance of stomach upset for some people.</li>

        <li><strong>Alcohol (especially in excess):</strong> Alcohol can impair hydration and recovery. Occasional intake is fine, but heavy drinking works against the benefits of creatine.</li>

        <li><strong>Low fluid intake:</strong> Creatine pulls water into muscle cells. Staying well hydrated is important.</li>

        <li><strong>Taking creatine on an empty stomach (for sensitive individuals):</strong> May cause mild gastrointestinal discomfort. Taking it with food usually helps.</li>

        <li><strong>Ultra-processed diets:</strong> Creatine works best when paired with adequate protein, carbohydrates, and overall good nutrition.</li>
        </ul>

<p><strong>Good news:</strong> There are no specific foods you must avoid when taking creatine. It doesn’t interact negatively with normal, balanced meals.</p>


    <h2>A Gentle Note on Age, Responsibility, and Common Sense</h2>

        <p>While creatine is one of the most researched and well-tolerated supplements available, context always matters.</p>

        <p>Most studies focus on adults aged 18 and over. For younger individuals, especially children and early teenagers, the priority should always be a balanced diet, regular physical activity, proper sleep, and healthy development — not supplementation.</p>

        <p>Older teenagers who are training seriously may consider creatine, but ideally with guidance from a qualified health or fitness professional and alongside good nutrition habits.</p>

        <p>If you have a medical condition, kidney disease, or are taking medication, it’s always sensible to speak with a healthcare professional before starting any supplement — creatine included.</p>

        <p>Creatine doesn’t replace good habits. It simply supports them.</p>

     <h2>A Note on Creatine and Pregnancy</h2>

        <p><strong>Important:</strong> While creatine is naturally produced by the body and widely researched in adults, there is currently insufficient high-quality research to recommend creatine supplementation during pregnancy.</p>

        <p>For this reason, most healthcare professionals advise that pregnant women:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>Continue appropriate physical activity, as advised by a healthcare provider</li>
        <li>Focus on meeting nutritional needs through whole foods</li>
        <li>Avoid non-essential supplements unless specifically recommended by a doctor or midwife</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is not because creatine is proven to be harmful during pregnancy, but because it has not yet been proven safe in this specific context. During pregnancy, caution and simplicity are usually the best approach.</p>

 <h2>Who Should Not Take Creatine (or Should Pause It)</h2>

        <p>Creatine is safe for the vast majority of healthy adults. However, there are situations where it may be sensible to avoid or temporarily pause supplementation.</p>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>People with diagnosed kidney disease:</strong> Creatine should only be used under medical supervision.</li>
        <li><strong>During pregnancy or breastfeeding:</strong> Due to limited research, supplementation is generally not recommended.</li>
        <li><strong>During severe illness:</strong> If experiencing vomiting, diarrhea, fever, or significant dehydration, it may be wise to pause creatine until normal hydration and recovery return.</li>
        <li><strong>Children and young adolescents:</strong> Supplementation is unnecessary; focus should be on nutrition, movement, and sleep.</li>
        <li><strong>Anyone taking medication:</strong> A healthcare professional should be consulted before starting supplementation.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For most healthy adults, creatine can be used safely, consistently, and long-term when combined with good hydration and sensible dosing.</p>

    <blockquote>

        <p>From early mornings in Alfândega da Fé, to lunches at home, to quiet coffees at the pastelaria, and finally breakfast by the river in Mirandela — this conversation about creatine unfolded the way real learning often does.</p>

        <p>Not through headlines or hype, but through questions. Honest ones. Sometimes hesitant. Sometimes misinformed. Always human.</p>

        <p>Creatine, like many things in health and fitness, isn’t good or bad on its own. It’s contextual. It depends on age, lifestyle, goals, health status, and life stage.</p>

        <p>For younger adults, it can support training and performance. For older adults, it can help preserve strength, muscle, and independence. For vegetarians and vegans, it may fill a natural gap. And for others — such as during pregnancy — it may simply not be necessary.</p>

        <p>What matters most is understanding <em>why</em> you’re taking something, not just <em>what</em> you’re taking.</p>

        <p>As a CPD-accredited health, wellness, and fitness coach — and as a husband, father, and lifelong trainee — I’ve learned that the best decisions are rarely rushed. They’re informed, calm, and grounded in evidence.</p>

        <p>Sometimes, all it takes is a good conversation over coffee.</p>
