    <h2>From Plates to Physiology</h2>

    <p>
      <a href="./2026-02-06-food-puzzel-4.html">In the previous post, </a>we looked at how the food pyramid reshaped our
      plates — placing carbohydrates at the centre and pushing protein to the
      margins.
    </p>

    <p>But diagrams don’t have blood sugar.</p>

    <p>People do.</p>

    <p>
      In this post, we move from policy and habit into biology — into muscle,
      aging, and the quiet assumptions we’ve carried forward for decades.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>After Lunch, Over a Bica</h2>

    <p>We’ve just finished lunch.</p>

    <p>The plates are cleared. The kitchen is calm again.</p>

    <p>We’re standing by the counter, each holding a <em>bica</em>.</p>

    <p>“How I miss having the children here,” my wife says softly.</p>

    <p>
      She’s thinking about when my son and daughter-in-law came all the way from
      South Africa for the holidays.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Yes,” I reply, “it was great. I hope they repeat it soon. I miss them
      terribly.”
    </p>

    <p>There’s a pause.</p>

    <p>Then she smiles.</p>

    <p>
      “Talking about the food pyramid,” she says, “do you remember that heated
      debate you had with Carmen?”
    </p>

    <p>I laugh.</p>

    <p>How could I forget?</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>The Question That Always Comes Up</h2>

    <p>
      “Carbs versus protein,” my wife continues. “Carmen asked you — health-wise
      — if you had to pick just one.”
    </p>

    <p>I nod.</p>

    <p>
      “She said it had to be carbohydrates,” I reply. “And I said no — I’d pick
      protein. And probably a little fat above carbs.”
    </p>

    <p>At the time, it sounded provocative.</p>

    <p>But it wasn’t ideology.</p>

    <p>It was biology.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Protein Is Not Just Calories</h2>

    <p>
      One of the biggest mistakes in nutrition is treating protein as
      interchangeable with carbohydrates.
    </p>

    <p>They’re not.</p>

    <p>Carbohydrates are primarily energy.</p>

    <p>Protein is structure.</p>

    <p>
      Every cell, enzyme, hormone, and muscle fibre depends on amino acids — the
      building blocks of protein.
    </p>

    <p>
      And unlike carbohydrates, the body does not store protein efficiently.
    </p>

    <p><strong>You either eat enough.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Or you break down your own tissue.</strong></p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Not All Proteins Are Equal</h2>

    <p>This is where the story gets uncomfortable.</p>

    <p><strong>Protein quality matters.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Bioavailability matters.</strong></p>

    <p>Amino acid composition matters.</p>

    <p>Animal-based proteins generally provide:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><u>Complete amino acid profiles</u></li>
      <li><u>Higher leucine content</u></li>
      <li><u>Greater digestibility</u></li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Plant proteins can be part of a healthy diet —
      <strong
        >but often require careful combination and larger quantities to achieve
        the same biological effect.</strong
      >
    </p>

    <p><strong>The food pyramid never made this distinction.</strong></p>

    <p>It counted grams.</p>

    <p>Not outcomes.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Bioavailability in protein digestion is the proportion of amino acids
        from ingested protein that are actually digested, absorbed, and utilized
        by the body for metabolic functions, rather than being wasted.
      </p>
      <p>
        It determines how effectively a protein source is used for tissue repair
        and muscle building, with animal proteins (e.g., whey, eggs) typically
        having higher bioavailability than plant-based sources.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Muscle: The Metabolic Organ We Ignored</h2>

    <p>For decades, muscle was seen as cosmetic.</p>

    <p>Something athletes cared about.</p>

    <p>
      <strong
        >But muscle is one of the most important metabolic organs in the
        body.</strong
      >
    </p>

    <p>It:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><u>Improves insulin sensitivity</u></li>
      <li><u>Acts as a glucose sink</u></li>
      <li><u>Supports mobility and independence</u></li>
      <li><u>Protects against frailty</u></li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>And muscle is built — and maintained — with protein.</strong></p>

    <p>Especially as we age.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Aging Changes the Rules</h2>

    <p><em>Older adults require more protein, not less.</em></p>

    <p>
      Yet most guidelines still reflect minimums established for young, active
      men during wartime.
    </p>

    <p>This mismatch has consequences:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><u>Sarcopenia</u></li>
      <li><u>Loss of strength</u></li>
      <li><u>Increased fall risk</u></li>
      <li><u>Metabolic decline</u></li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Eating “enough” protein on paper doesn't mean eating enough for your
      biology.

    <hr />

    <h2>The Quiet Cost of Getting It Wrong</h2>

    <p>When protein is sidelined, the body adapts — but at a cost.</p>

    <p>Muscle slowly erodes.</p>

    <p>Blood sugar control worsens.</p>

    <p>Recovery slows.</p>

    <p>And we call it aging.</p>

    <p>Often, it's <strong>undernutrition.</strong></p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Coming Up Next</h2>

    <p>Understanding protein quality is important.</p>

    <p>But understanding how to apply it is what really matters.</p>

    <p>
      <strong>So how do you actually eat differently in the real world?</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      In the final post of this series, we’ll turn theory into practice — with
      real meals, real plates, and a practical upside-down food pyramid.

    <h2>My Perspective</h2>

    <p>
      As an accredited
      <strong>CPD Fitness, Health, Nutrition, and Wellness Coach</strong>, I see
      people who are aging faster than they should — not because of genetics,
      but because of nutrition mismatched to their biology.
    </p>

    <p>Protein isn’t a trend.</p>

    <p>It’s a requirement.</p>

    <p>
      And understanding its role is one of the most powerful steps toward
      healthier aging.
