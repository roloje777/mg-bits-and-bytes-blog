<p><em>Part 5 of the series: <strong>The Upside-Down Food Pyramid</strong></em></p>

<hr>

<h2>From Plates to Physiology</h2>

<p>In the previous post, we looked at how the food pyramid reshaped our plates — placing carbohydrates at the centre and pushing protein to the margins.</p>

<p>But diagrams don’t have blood sugar.</p>

<p>People do.</p>

<p>In this post, we move from policy and habit into biology — into muscle, aging, and the quiet assumptions we’ve carried forward for decades.</p>

<hr>

<h2>After Lunch, Over a Bica</h2>

<p>We’ve just finished lunch.</p>

<p>The plates are cleared. The kitchen is calm again.</p>

<p>We’re standing by the counter, each holding a <em>bica</em>.</p>

<p>“How I miss having the children here,” my wife says softly.</p>

<p>She’s thinking about when my son and daughter-in-law came all the way from South Africa for the holidays.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I reply, “it was great. I hope they repeat it soon. I miss them terribly.”</p>

<p>There’s a pause.</p>

<p>Then she smiles.</p>

<p>“Talking about the food pyramid,” she says, “do you remember that heated debate you had with Carmen?”</p>

<p>I laugh.</p>

<p>How could I forget?</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Question That Always Comes Up</h2>

<p>“Carbs versus protein,” my wife continues. “Carmen asked you — health-wise — if you had to pick just one.”</p>

<p>I nod.</p>

<p>“She said it had to be carbohydrates,” I reply. “And I said no — I’d pick protein. And probably a little fat above carbs.”</p>

<p>At the time, it sounded provocative.</p>

<p>But it wasn’t ideology.</p>

<p>It was biology.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Protein Is Not Just Calories</h2>

<p>One of the biggest mistakes in nutrition is treating protein as interchangeable with carbohydrates.</p>

<p>They’re not.</p>

<p>Carbohydrates are primarily energy.</p>

<p>Protein is structure.</p>

<p>Every cell, enzyme, hormone, and muscle fibre depends on amino acids — the building blocks of protein.</p>

<p>And unlike carbohydrates, the body does not store protein efficiently.</p>

<p>You either eat enough.</p>

<p>Or you break down your own tissue.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Not All Proteins Are Equal</h2>

<p>This is where the story gets uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Protein quality matters.</p>

<p>Bioavailability matters.</p>

<p>Amino acid composition matters.</p>

<p>Animal-based proteins generally provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Complete amino acid profiles</li>
  <li>Higher leucine content</li>
  <li>Greater digestibility</li>
</ul>

<p>Plant proteins can be part of a healthy diet — but often require careful combination and larger quantities to achieve the same biological effect.</p>

<p>The food pyramid never made this distinction.</p>

<p>It counted grams.</p>

<p>Not outcomes.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Muscle: The Metabolic Organ We Ignored</h2>

<p>For decades, muscle was seen as cosmetic.</p>

<p>Something athletes cared about.</p>

<p>But muscle is one of the most important metabolic organs in the body.</p>

<p>It:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Improves insulin sensitivity</li>
  <li>Acts as a glucose sink</li>
  <li>Supports mobility and independence</li>
  <li>Protects against frailty</li>
</ul>

<p>And muscle is built — and maintained — with protein.</p>

<p>Especially as we age.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Aging Changes the Rules</h2>

<p>Older adults require more protein, not less.</p>

<p>Yet most guidelines still reflect minimums established for young, active men during wartime.</p>

<p>This mismatch has consequences:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sarcopenia</li>
  <li>Loss of strength</li>
  <li>Increased fall risk</li>
  <li>Metabolic decline</li>
</ul>

<p>Eating “enough” protein on paper doesn’t mean eating enough for your biology.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Quiet Cost of Getting It Wrong</h2>

<p>When protein is sidelined, the body adapts — but at a cost.</p>

<p>Muscle slowly erodes.</p>

<p>Blood sugar control worsens.</p>

<p>Recovery slows.</p>

<p>And we call it aging.</p>

<p>Often, it’s undernutrition.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Coming Up Next</h2>

<p>Understanding protein quality is important.</p>

<p>But understanding how to apply it is what really matters.</p>

<p><strong>So how do you actually eat differently in the real world?</strong></p>

<p>In the final post of this series, we’ll turn theory into practice — with real meals, real plates, and a practical upside-down food pyramid.</p>

<h2>My Perspective</h2>

<p>As an accredited <strong>CPD Fitness, Health, Nutrition, and Wellness Coach</strong>, I see people who are aging faster than they should — not because of genetics, but because of nutrition mismatched to their biology.</p>

<p>Protein isn’t a trend.</p>

<p>It’s a requirement.</p>

<p>And understanding its role is one of the most powerful steps toward healthier aging.</p>
