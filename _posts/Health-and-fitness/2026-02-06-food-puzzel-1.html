    <h2>A Coffee, a Pastry, and an Uncomfortable Realisation</h2>

    <p>
      My wife and I are sitting at a small <em>pastelaria</em>, coffees in hand.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Can you believe it,” she says quietly, “a young boy has been diagnosed
      with diabetes. I didn’t even know children could get diabetes.”
    </p>

    <p>“Yes,” I reply, “it seems like it’s becoming more common these days.”</p>

    <p>But my mind has already wandered.</p>

    <p>
      I’m thinking about a podcast I listened to not long ago —
      <strong>“0.8g Is Not Enough: The New Protein Rules”</strong>, featuring
      Dr. Donald Layman. A deep dive into protein, muscle, metabolism… and how
      the food pyramid may have got things very wrong.
    </p>

    <p>
      The conversation in the café fades into background noise as a familiar
      thought resurfaces.
    </p>

    <p>The food pyramid wasn’t built to make us healthier.</p>

    <p>It was built to feed populations cheaply.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Wheat Fields and Forgotten Choices</h2>

    <p>
      My thoughts drift to another conversation. This time, in our sitting room.
    </p>

    <p>
      My wife, her elderly cousin — now in her late seventies — and I, chatting
      casually.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Did you know,” her cousin says, “that when I was a child, during
      Salazar’s time, we didn’t plant olive trees, almonds, or cherries?”
    </p>

    <p>“So what did you plant?” I ask.</p>

    <p>
      “Wheat,” she replies. “My father planted wheat. Everyone planted wheat.”
    </p>

    <p>That conversation stuck with me.</p>

    <p>Then another memory layers itself on top.</p>

    <p>
      My wife was born in Mozambique. She often talks about her parents’ rice
      farm — fertile land, predictable harvests, food that travelled far beyond
      where it was grown.
    </p>

    <p>Wheat here. Rice there.</p>

    <p>Different lands. Same logic.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>“João… João…”</h2>

    <p>“João… João…”</p>

    <p>I snap back to the present.</p>

    <p>“Did you hear me?” my wife asks.</p>

    <p>“Ah… yes,” I reply, smiling.</p>

    <p>“So what do you think about what we were just talking about?”</p>

    <p>I pause.</p>

    <p>“I’ve solved the puzzle,” I say.</p>

    <p>“What puzzle?” she asks, raising an eyebrow.</p>

    <p>“The upside-down food puzzle.”</p>

    <p>She looks unconvinced.</p>

    <p>
      “It all started after the Second World War,” I continue. “And it has very
      little to do with eating healthier.”
    </p>

    <p>“What?”</p>

    <p>I smile again.</p>

    <p>
      “Order us another coffee,” I say. “Mine can be a <em>galão</em>. This is
      going to take a while.”
    </p>

    <h2>What This Series Is About</h2>

    <p>This blog series is not about blaming individuals.</p>

    <p>It’s about understanding how:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Post-war scarcity shaped nutrition policy</li>
      <li>Carbohydrates became the foundation of official diets</li>
      <li>Protein was quietly sidelined</li>
      <li>
        Countries like Portugal — and its colonies — became living case studies
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Most importantly, it’s about asking whether guidelines designed for
      survival still make sense in a world facing obesity, diabetes, and muscle
      loss.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Coming Up Next</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>In the next post:</strong> We rewind the clock to post-war Europe
      and the United States to explore how nutrition guidelines were born out of
      logistics, rationing, and political necessity — not human biology.

      <strong>Coming soon.</strong><br />
      Part 2 dives into how food policy was designed to feed nations at scale —
      not necessarily to nourish individual bodies.
      <br /><br />
      📬 Stay tuned — it’s in the oven.

    <h2>My Perspective</h2>

    <p>
      I’m writing this not just as a curious observer, but as an accredited
      <strong>CPD Fitness, Health, Nutrition, and Wellness Coach</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the years, I’ve watched well-intentioned guidelines produce very real
      unintended consequences — especially when muscle health, protein quality,
      and metabolic reality are ignored.
    </p>

    <p>
      This series is my attempt to connect history, policy, and biology — and to
      ask better questions about how we ended up eating the way we do.
    </p>
