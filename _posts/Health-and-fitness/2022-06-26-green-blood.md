If you have blue blood, you may be an octopus (or just a rich human), but if you have green blood, you may have sulfhemoglobinemia.

This interesting phenomenon occurs when a haemoglobin molecule (the molecule that allows our red blood cells to transport oxygen around our bodies) incorporates a sulphur atom into its structure and becomes ﻿sulfhemoglobin.

The treatment for sulfhemoglobinemia is a simple one: Just wait it out.  
Red blood cells have a natural lifespan of about 100 days, after which they’re broken down and their components recycled.  
So, after about 3 months, any red blood cells that contain sulfhemoglobin will have been recycled into proper red blood cells, and any non-red tint to the blood will have disappeared.
