      <h2>Foreword</h2>
      As you may have noticed, I like to add some of my personal experiences when I write my blogs.<br>
      In the years that have gone by, some of us, may relate <strong>Eggs</strong> with the dreaded inhibitor <strong>Fear.</strong><br>
      <hr>
      Now I've been working on my 'slide show' that you'll see further down when reading this blog.<br>
      Apart from sharing photos of characters that had a big influence in my 'childhood world',
      a world in which all children should live in, a world full of adventure.<br>
      &quot;At times ,I find myself in that world, even at 60 years old, still day dreaming for adventures..&quot;, I smile to myself...üòÑ<br>
      While sorting the cats litter, a little üòà sits on my shoulder, - &quot;should I or, should'nt I 
      add the photos of my childhood in the slides?&quot;<br>
      Then I recall the phrase, from a book I read a while back.<br>
      <div class="image-container" style="margin-top:0.5em">
        <img src="https://static.fnac-static.com/multimedia/Images/PT/NR/ca/7b/11/1145802/1540-1.jpg" alt="Feal the Fear and Do It Anywat">

      </div>
      <strong>Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway ...</strong>
      <hr>
      My mind goes back to sometime in the past.<br>
      It does that often you know...üòÅ<br>
      My two kids are visiting us on their holiday.<br>
      They've traveled all the way from South Africa and we're all sitting in our modest kitchen having a great chat when the topic 
      changes to <strong>Carbs versus Fats</strong>.<br>
      Carmen - &quot;Mr. Rolo, pick one, carbs or fats.&quot;"<br>
      Me - &quot;I cannot pick one, they're both ...&quot<br>
      Carmen - &quot; How can you say that?, surely it's carbs, they're ...&quot;<br>
      <hr>
      Now thinking of that conversation today and the debate (in my head) on the photos, it is not unlike  one's fear for the dreaded
      üëæ under our bed as a child, Cholesterol, eggs, or in this case my photos.<br>
      <hr>
      Lastly, I'll have a <strong>bonus on Eggs</strong> for you at the end of this rather lengthy blog, so make sure to read it to the end.<br>
      If your have a little spare time after this, I'd love to read you comments.<br>
      enjoy...<br>

          In the seventies the <strong>Iconic Box Office movie</strong

          <p>
            Rocky is a 1976 American independent sports drama film directed by
            John G. Avildsen and written by and starring Sylvester Stallone.<br />
            Rocky entered development in March 1975, after Stallone wrote the
            screenplay in three days.<br />
            It entered a complicated production process after Stallone refused
            to allow the film to be made without him in the lead role; United
            Artists eventually agreed to cast Stallone after he rejected a six
            figure deal for the film rights.<br />
            Principal photography began in January 1976, with filming primarily
            held in Philadelphia; several locations featured in the film, such
            as the Rocky Steps, are now considered cultural landmarks.<br />
            With an estimated production budget of under $1 million, Rocky
            popularized the rags to riches and American Dream themes of sports
            dramas which preceded the film.<br />

        Now when one eats eggs for breakfast there is always the rhetoric:
        <li>Eggs are not good for you</li>
        <li>They are good, but don't eat eggs every day.</li>
        <li>Watch out for that dreaded word, <strong>Cholesterol</strong></li>
        <li>They are good for you, but in moderation</li>
        <li>Only eat the egg whites</li>
        <li>etc,...etc .. etc</li>
      </ul>
      Well, I must be wired differently.<br />
      When I eat eggs, it reminds me of that awesome movie where an 'old school
      clock's' alarm goes off at 04:00 in the morning, and Rocky stands up, goes
      to his kitchen, breaks a couple of eggs (I think 5 in total giving you
      around 32 grams of protein) into a flask and downs them before going for
      his morning run.<br />
      &quot;Wow, what an awesome scene.&quot;<br />

      It was early morning and I was standing in the front of wardrobe looking
      into the mirror while changing from my Pjs.<br />
      Wife - &quot; ... at sixty you still stand and admire your body.<br />
      You're like a teenager,... a sixty year old teenager.&quot; and laughs as

      Being a young lad, I looked up to guys like
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Reeves">Steve Reeves,</a>
      a body builder and actor, famous for his role in Hercules, as well as
      other male figures such as,
      <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee">Bruce Lee</a>, founder of Jeet Kune Do ,
      a hybrid martial arts philosophy derived from different combat disciplines that is often credited 
      with paving the way for mixed martial arts (MMA ) and
      <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger">Arnold, </a>
      an Austrian - American bodybuilder , actor , businessman , and politician who served as the 38th Governor 
      of California from 2004 to 2011, among many others, made me an instant fan of Sylvester Stallone.<br />
      Growing up in the seventies, we did not have access to toys like XBox and PlayStation.<br />
      What we did have access to were adventure photo books, such as Tarzan,
      Arend, Tessa and Kit Colt, Son Of Samson,Die Wit Tier, DC and Marvel
      Comic, bicycles, marbles, tops, soccer balls and sun and rain...<br />

      At school we even had seasons, - Marble season, Tops Season, Soccer season...<br>
      One of my early lessons in working as a team member was in of those seasons, 
      namely marble season.<br>
      A friend of mine, 'Rui' and I decided to team up.<br>
      At the end of that season we had a desk full of marbles.<br>

      like that ...., it was awesome.<br />
      I recall my pals and I spending weekends, devouring those books and our
      parents telling us to stop reading them as we were reading second grade
      books.<br />
      Today as a Father of 60, I thank that world, as we spent hours devouring
      these books

          A gym, short for gymnasium ( pl. : gymnasiums or gymnasia), is an
          indoor venue for exercise and sports. The word is derived from the
          ancient Greek term 'gymnasion'.<br />
          They are commonly found in athletic and fitness centres, and as

      I explained further that if I had to open a gym, beginners when starting

      delving into the actual physical training.<br />
      I honestly believe, that nutrition is of utmost importance, and neglected
      in todays gymnasia and if I had some training on that in my earlier years,
      I'd have achieved much more.<br />

      <h2>The History Of Eggs</h2>

        The word egg tracks it name back to a prehistoric Indo-European, which
        was the word for bird.<br />
        The Old English term was <strong>oeg</strong>, which survived in Middle

        Humans have been consuming eggs since the dawn of human time. <br />
        In actual fact, there is archaeoligical evidence for egg
        consumption dating back as far as 10 000 years before Christ (Neolithic or Stone
        Age).<br />

        Eggs have been known to, and enjoyed by, humans for many centuries.<br />
        Jungle fowl were domesticated in India by 3200 B.C.E.<br />
        Records from China and Egypt show that fowl were domesticated and laying
        eggs for human consumption around 1400 B.C.E., and The Romans found
        egg-laying hens in England, Gaul, and among the Germans.<br />
        The first domesticated fowl reached North America with the second voyage
        of Columbus in 1493.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Domesticated chickens and eating their eggs is believed to have started
        in China 6000 years before Christ.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Culinary evidence confirms breads and cakes using eggs were made by
        Ancient Egyptian and Roman peoples.<br> In the Roman period pastry cooks
        made much use of eggs for desserts as well as cakes.<br />
        Apicius (25 BC) invented baked custard: milk, honey and eggs beaten and
        cooked in an eartheware dish on gentle heat.<br />

      <h2>Egg's Bad Rap</h2>
      About 60% of the calories in eggs are from fat‚Äîmuch of which is saturated fat.<br>
      Eggs are also loaded with cholesterol‚Äîabout 200 milligrams for an average-sized egg.<br>
      That's more than double the amount in a Big Mac.<br>
      Now fat and cholesterol is believed to contribute to heart disease.<br>
      So it is natural to think that eggs are bad for you.<br>

      <h2>Eggs and nutrition</h2>
      <p>
        &quot;The egg is a packed nutritional powerhouse,&quot; says Angel Planells,
        a registered dietitian in Seattle and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition 
        and Dietetics.<br>
        &quot;The nutrients in eggs include plenty of protein and vitamin D, he says.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Egg yolks also are an especially rich source of the ‚Äúbrain nutrient‚Äù choline,&quot; 
          says Dawn Jackson Blatner, a Chicago registered dietitian and author of Superfood Swap.<br>
        </p>
        
        <p>
        A 2019 review suggests that most of the nutrients in an egg are in the yolk.<br>
        The distribution of the proteins, however, is even throughout the whole egg.<br>

<ul>
  The egg yolk provides-
  <li>A lower risk of gastrointestinal distress:</li>
  <li>A boosted immune system</li>
  <li>Lower blood pressure</li>
  <li>Reduced risk of vision problems</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  Egg yolks contain at least seven essential minerals, including:
  <li>calcium</li>
  <li>iron</li>
  <li>magnesium</li>
  <li>phosphorus</li>
  <li>potassium</li>
  <li>sodium</li>
  <li>zinc</li>
</ul>
me-&quot;And here many of us avoid eggs like the plage, and pop pills to get these nutrients.&quot;ü§îüò±<br>

            Did you know that if you want to <span class="my-p">build muscle,</span> one should get around 1.2 to 2 grams of
            protein per kilogram of your body weight?<br>
            It is recommended that no one drops below 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight.<br>
            Now before the so called <strong>bad rap</strong> of fat, whole milk and eggs were the 
            goto foods for protein.<br>
            There are on average between 5.2 and 7.5 grams of protein in an egg, depending on its size.<br>
            Eggs are an excellent source of natural protein and are also relatively cheap when compared to other high-protein 
           foods such as meat.<br>

            <h3>How much protein do you need? </h3>
            Anywhere from 10% to 35% of your calories should 
            come from protein.
            <br> So if your needs are 2,000 calories, that's 200‚Äì700 calories from protein,
             or 50-175 grams.<br>
             The recommended dietary allowance to prevent deficiency for an average sedentary 
             adult is 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight.<br>

        <h3>Yolk vs. egg white</h3>
        Me-&quot;Did you note in the video clip above, that Rocky drank the whole egg?&quot;<br>
        <p>          
       The egg white gives one around 3.6 g of protein in the yolk of a single, large egg, 
       while the yolk provides around 2.7 grams.<br>
      While the white provides more protein, the yolk contains nearly all of the 
      fat- <strong>and water-soluble vitamins and minerals</strong> in eggs.<br>
      Research suggests that consuming whole eggs has more significant benefits 
      than eating egg whites alone.<br>
      <strong>In a 2017 study found that young men who ate whole eggs immediately after 
        performing resistance exercises had higher rates of muscle metabolism than 
        those who consumed only egg whites.</strong><br>          
        </p>
        Me-&quot;Rocky must have known this already in 1976.&quot;üòÇ<br>

      <h2>Why I say Eggs are healthy for you</h2>
      <framed-text>
      Me- &quot;Now , I'm not saying I'm an expert on the matter.<br>
      Please read my blog with a pinch of salt, and one should do one's own research.<br>
      As always I attach the references at the end on my blogs, which you are welcome to refer to.&quot;<br>
      </framed-text>
      <p>
        Although eggs are a breakfast staple for many people, they tend get a bad 
        rap for their cholesterol content.<br> But you may be surprised to learn that 
        eggs contain eight essential nutrients, protein, healthy fats and antioxidants.<br>
        Plus, they are affordable, easy to cook and versatile.<br>
        <strong>And believe it or not, the cholesterol in eggs isn't actually linked to raising
          blood cholesterol levels.</strong><br>
        Recent research has determined that eating cholesterol is not associated with an increase in 
        blood cholesterol.<br> 
        &quot;While past research confused the public regarding if it was truly safe to eat eggs on a 
        regular basis out of fear of cardiovascular disease, recent research has since disproved this 
        notion,&quot; said registered dietitian Elizabeth Shaw.<br>
        As a matter of fact, the American Heart Association recommends eggs as a source of protein in a 
        heart-healthy diet.<br>
        <strong>A study of more than 400,000 adults in Europe found no link 
          between egg consumption and cardiovascular disease risk.<br>
          Actually, the study found that higher egg intake was associated 
          with lower risk of having a heart attack.¬†<br>
        </strong> <br>        
      </p>
      <p>
        Eggs are also one of the only natural food sources of vitamin D, a nutrient that <strong>promotes 
          calcium absorption for bone health.</strong><br>
        &quot;I feel sorry for the aged, being too frail to go outside, and eggs are a no no.&quot;ü§î
        Vitamin D plays a role in many other bodily functions, such as combatting inflammation, 
        cell growth, immune function and glucose metabolism.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄúEggs are also <strong>one of the highest concentrated sources of choline, which plays an integral part 
          in liver, brain and muscle function, as well as metabolism and cell membrane composition.</strong><br>
        Most notably, choline is involved in fetal brain and spinal cord development, making it a <strong>crucial
          nutrient for pregnant people.</strong><br>
      </p>
      <p>
      Eggs contain lutein and zeaxanthin, two antioxidants that are known to improve or <strong>prevent 
        macular disease,</strong> the leading cause of blindness and vision impairment.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Contrary to what you may see on social media, you actually want to eat the whole egg 
        (yep, yolk included) to reap the full nutritional benefits,&quot;
         said Shaw.<br>
         <strong>The yolk houses most of the nutrients, </strong>including the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K, 
         as well as all of the choline, lutein and zeaxanthin.<br>
      </p> 
      <h3>Note</h3>      
      <p> 
      <strong>It is worth noting that many of the studies did not test the effects of egg yolks in humans.<br>
        Instead, they performed the tests in a laboratory or on animals.</strong><br>
      <dov class="image-container">
        <img src="https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/j1o5WIvl843z50ia3IIfVtdy_Tw=/fit-in/1072x0/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer/c5/70/c5700276-c8c4-4e12-a610-c40b05cb0b9c/2527b7d7803fc51bcf225e6af6a67a13.jpg"

      </dov>
       Therefore, the findings may not apply to humans.<br>
       Since 2015, the federal government's Dietary Guidelines for Americans have set <strong>no specific cholesterol limit.</strong><br>
       The guidelines say eggs can be part of a healthy diet.<br>
       More recently, in proposed new rules, the Food and Drug Administration said eggs can be labeled as <strong>heathy food.üëç</strong> <br>
       The heart association now says that an egg a day is fine for most people and that older adults with normal blood cholesterol and a heart-healthy diet 
       can safely eat up to two.<br>
       People with high cholesterol should be more cautious about consuming cholesterol, the group says.

      <h2>Like anything in life. Don't overdo it</h2>
      One large egg has 1.5 grams of saturated fat, which is a little more than 13% the daily value (in a 2,000 calorie diet).<br>
      Therefore, eating more than one egg per day can really add up, especially if you eat other animal foods.<br>
      While eggs have many health benefits, it‚Äôs best to limit your intake to one or two eggs per day.<br>

      <h2>The Bonus As Promised</h2>
      I was sitting in bed, eating my breakfast(Lupins, Peanuts and an espresso), giving me a whopping 25grams of protein
      , while watching the news on SIC TV.<br>
      An advert catches my attention...<br>
      The advert shows things rolling off some objects and a lady instinctively catching it.<br>
      Later on it shows her grabbing her throat and the advert ends with her catching a box of Meboca√çna pills.<br>
      I found this rather intriguing as the first object is an <strong>EGG</strong> and as I'm currently
      researching eggs for this blog I googled <strong> 'Eggs and a sore throat'.</strong> <br>

      Well!!<br>
     &quot; You got a sore throat, go get a box of 'Meboca√çna'.&quot;<br>

        Zinc, selenium, iron, vitamin B12, and vitamin D are some of the many nutrients in eggs that can combat and

        Consider making scrambled eggs, which are warm, soft, and easy to chew and swallow.<br>
