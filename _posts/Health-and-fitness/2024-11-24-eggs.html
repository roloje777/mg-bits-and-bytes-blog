            Rocky is a 1976 American independent sports drama film directed by
            John G. Avildsen and written by and starring Sylvester Stallone.<br />
            Rocky entered development in March 1975, after Stallone wrote the
            screenplay in three days.<br />
            It entered a complicated production process after Stallone refused
            to allow the film to be made without him in the lead role; United
            Artists eventually agreed to cast Stallone after he rejected a six
            figure deal for the film rights.<br />
            Principal photography began in January 1976, with filming primarily
            held in Philadelphia; several locations featured in the film, such
            as the Rocky Steps, are now considered cultural landmarks.<br />
            With an estimated production budget of under $1 million, Rocky
            popularized the rags to riches and American Dream themes of sports
            dramas which preceded the film.<br />

        Now when one eats eggs for breakfast there is always the rhetoric:
        <li>Eggs are not good for you</li>
        <li>They are good, but don't eat eggs every day.</li>
        <li>Watch out for that dreaded word, <strong>Cholesterol</strong></li>
        <li>They are good for you, but in moderation</li>
        <li>Only eat the egg whites</li>
        <li>etc,...etc .. etc</li>
      </ul>  
      Well, I must be wired differently.<br>
      When I eat eggs, it reminds me of that awesome movie where an 'old school clock's' alarm goes off at
      04:00 in the morning, and Rocky stands up, goes to his kitchen, breaks a couple of eggs (I think 5 in total
      giving you around 32 grams of protein) into a flask and downs them before going for his morning run.<br>
      Wow, that an awesome scene.<br>
      Like kids like to say today, thats the bomb,  üëäüèªüí£üí•<br>

      It was early morning and I was standing in the front of wardrobe looking
      into the mirror while changing from my Pjs.<br />
      Wife - &quot; ... at sixty you still stand and admire your body.<br />
      You're like a teenager,... a sixty year old teenager.&quot; and laughs as
      she walks out of the room.<br />

      Me - &quot;What a great period for a young lad to grow up in.<br />
      ... young lads of today have lost some of that,<br />
      ... being proud of being a male..<br />
      The power that comes with their testosterone, <br />

      Well, what has this all got to do with eggs, you may be thinking, while indulging me and my blog.<br>
       Being interested in bodybuilding, the more one knows about nutrition, the better the results
      will be.<br />
      Now <strong>eggs</strong> has always ranked on the top of the food sources when it comes to
       feeding one's muscles with protein.<br>

      While I'm writing this blog, my thoughts go to a week or so ago, when I
      got a video call from an old pal of mine.<br />
      It was around 22:00 or later.<br>
      I look at the screen and I see it's Philip, my old gym partner.<br />

            At times after finishing our gym session, we'de stand outside having a

            A gym, short for gymnasium ( pl. : gymnasiums or gymnasia), is an indoor venue for 
            exercise and sports. The word is derived from the ancient Greek term "gymnasion".<br>
            They are commonly found in athletic and fitness centres, and as activity and learning spaces 
            in educational institutions.<br>

      We've (Philip and I) for well over an hour now, mainly on our gym days.<br>      
      Me - &quot;Weet jy wat Philip?&quot;<br>
      Philip - &quot;Wat&quot;
      <hr>
      I go to explain to him  that one of my dreams was to own a gym.<br>
      Philip - "&quot;Nee, ek het dit nie geweet nie&quot;<br>
      <hr>
      I explain further that if I had to open a gym, beginners when starting ayt my place would
      first undergo some education on nutrition, before even delving into the actual physical training.<br>
      I honestly believe, that nutrition is of utmost importance, and neglected in todays
      gymnasia and if I had some training on that in my earlier years, I'd have achieved much more.<br>
