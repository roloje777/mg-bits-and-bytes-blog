      <h2>From Fields to Plates</h2>

      <p>
        <a href="./2026-02-06-food-puzzel-3.html" >In the previous post,</a> we followed post-war nutrition policy as it moved
        from global strategy into Portuguese fields — wheat on the mainland,
        rice in the colonies, and calories above all else.
      </p>

      <p>In this post, we follow that same logic one step further.</p>

      <p>Because crops don’t stay on farms.</p>

      <p>They become meals.</p>

      <p>And eventually, they become rules.</p>

      <hr />

      <h2>Back Home, Planning Lunch</h2>

      <p>We’ve arrived back at the house.</p>

      <p>
        The kitchen is quiet. Groceries are on the counter. Lunch is being
        planned.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Chicken breasts,” my wife says, “with oven-baked fries and a glass of
        water.”
      </p>

      <p>I smile.</p>

      <p>“Protein first, then carbs.”</p>

      <p>“Always,” she replies without hesitation.</p>

      <p>Then she looks at me.</p>

      <p>“You weren’t finished with the food pyramid, were you?”</p>

      <p>Not even close.</p>

      <hr />

      <h2>The Food Pyramid: Simple, Clear — and Misleading</h2>

        <img
        src="https://www.nxsmediawire.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/107/2026/01/GettyImages-679619836.jpg?strip=1
        alt="Image of 1992 Food Pyramid"
      />

      <p>The food pyramid was elegant in its simplicity.</p>

      <p>A wide base. A narrow top. A clear message:</p>

      <p><strong>Eat mostly this. Eat a little of that.</strong></p>

      <p>At the base sat bread, rice, pasta, and cereals.</p>

      <p>Above them: fruits and vegetables.</p>

      <p><em>Then smaller portions of protein.</em></p>

      <p><em>And finally, fats — something to be limited, even feared.</em></p>

      <p><strong>It looked scientific.</strong></p>

      <p>It felt authoritative.</p>

      <p>
        But it<strong> encoded decades-old assumptions about food </strong> — assumptions born
        from wartime survival, not metabolic health.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>Institutional Eating: Where the Pyramid Took Root</h2>

      <p>The food pyramid didn’t spread because families demanded it.</p>

      <p>It spread because institutions adopted it.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>School lunches</li>
        <li>Hospitals</li>
        <li>Military meal planning</li>
        <li>Care homes</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These environments needed meals that were cheap, repeatable, and
        compliant with official guidelines.
      </p>

      <p>Carbohydrates fit perfectly.</p>

      <p>Protein was more expensive.</p>

      <p>Fat was controversial.</p>

      <p>So plates filled up with starch.</p>

      <hr />

      <h2>The Carbohydrate-Centric Plate</h2>

      <p>Over time, the pyramid became something else entirely.</p>

      <p>It became a plate.</p>

      <p>A typical meal now looked like this:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Large serving of pasta, rice, or potatoes</li>
        <li>Small portion of protein</li>
        <li>Minimal fat</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This wasn’t accidental.</p>

      <p><strong>It was policy, visualised.</strong></p>

      <p>And repeated.</p>

      <p>Day after day.</p>

      <hr />

      <h2>Diabetes, Insulin Resistance, and the Missing Context</h2>

      <p>
        No one designing the original food pyramid was <strong>thinking about</strong> insulin
        resistance.
      </p>

      <p>Or type 2 diabetes.</p>

      <p>Or metabolic syndrome.</p>

      <p>Those conditions were rare at the time.</p>

      <p>
        But decades later, we’re still following the same template — even as
        blood sugar disorders become increasingly common, and increasingly
        younger.
      </p>

      <p><strong>A carbohydrate-heavy diet demands strong insulin responses.</strong></p>

      <p><em>When that system breaks down, the consequences are predictable.</em></p>

      <hr />

      <h2>Why Protein Was Sidelined</h2>

      <p><strong>Protein wasn’t demonised.</strong></p>

      <p><strong>It was simply deprioritised.</strong></p>

      <p><strong>Seen as optional.</strong></p>

      <p>Something to “add on” rather than build around.</p>

      <p>The irony is that protein:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><em>Stabilises blood sugar</em></li>
        <li><em>Supports muscle and metabolic health</em></li>
        <li><em>Increases satiety</em></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        But none of those benefits mattered in a system designed to prevent
        starvation, not optimise physiology.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>Trained to Eat Backwards</h2>

      <p>
        By the time my wife says “protein first” in our kitchen, she's undoing
        decades of conditioning.
      </p>

      <p>
        We were trained — visually, institutionally, culturally — to eat
        carbohydrates first.
      </p>

      <p>The pyramid taught us that.</p>

      <p>Not because it was optimal.</p>

      <p><em>But because it was convenient.</em></p>

      <hr />

      <h2>Coming Up Next</h2>

      <p>Turning the pyramid upside down is only half the story.</p>

      <p>
        <strong
          >Because not all proteins are created equal — and that matters more
          than most people realise.</strong
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        In the next post, we’ll move from policy to biology, and look at protein
        quality, bioavailability, and muscle as a metabolic organ.

      <h2>My Perspective</h2>

      <p>
        As an accredited
        <strong>CPD Fitness, Health, Nutrition, and Wellness Coach</strong>, I
        work with people who are doing exactly what they were told — and still
        struggling.
      </p>

      <p>The problem isn’t discipline.</p>

      <p>It’s outdated guidance.</p>

      <p>
        Understanding how the food pyramid shaped our plates is a crucial step
        toward eating in a way that actually supports long-term health.
