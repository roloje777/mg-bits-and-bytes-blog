<h2>Introduction</h2>

A discussion came up on why is it that when one reaches 60 years and above most job recruiters shy away from considering them.<br>
The reason being that they are to old to manage a section, run a company etc. <br>
What I find intriguing is that most of the jobs are not within reach for the "old-aged" except if you plan to run a country.<br>
In a study ranging from 1789 to 2021 showed that the average age an american president took office for the first time was just under 57 years of age, Donald Trump being the oldest at just under 71 years of age in 2017, followed by Ronald Reagan at 69 years and 349 days in 1981<br>
As I write this blog, Donald Trump is a favourite to win the US elections and that would make him the oldest US president ever elected for office at around 78 years of age.<br>
Its ok, to put a senile geriatric with Alzheimer in charge of the most important position in a country, but not in managing a hamburger joint.<br>
Can it be that politicians know something about the potential of older people's decision making abilities compared to their younger counterparts?<br>

<h2>Super-Agers'</h2>

</div>
<p>
Dr. Rogalski’s research, initially conducted when she was at Northwestern University, which showed that super-agers’ brains looked more like 50- or 60-year-olds’ brains than their 80-year-old peers. <br>
When followed over several years, the super-agers’ brains atrophied at a slower rate than average.<br>
Scientists have been studying a subset of people they call “super-agers.”<br>
These individuals are age 80 and up, but they have the memory ability of a person 20 to 30 years younger.
</p>
<p>
The scientists found that the super-agers' had more volume in areas of the brain important for memory, most notably most the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex.<br>
They also had better preserved connectivity between regions in the front of the brain that are involved in cognition.<br>
Study finds strongest evidence to date of brain's ability to compensate for age-related cognitive decline.<br>
<strong>Brain imaging studies have shown that the brain does recruit other areas.</strong><br>
<p>
In a study published in the journal eLife, a team led by scientists at the University of Cambridge in collaboration with the University of Sussex have shown that when the brain recruits other areas, it improves performance specifically in the brains of older people.<br>
When the team analysed the images further using machine-learning, they found two areas of the brain that showed greater activity in the brains of older people, and also correlated with better performance on the task.<br>

  <p style="text-align:center">cuneus</p>
</div>
These areas were the cuneus, at the rear of the brain, and a region in the frontal cortex.<br>
<strong>The cuneus brain region is usually good at helping us stay focused on what we see.</strong><br>
Dr Ethan Knights from the Medical Research Council Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit at Cambridge said: <i>"Now that we've seen this compensation happening, we can start to ask questions about why it happens for some older people, but not others, and in some tasks, but not others.</i><br>
Is there something special about these people -- their education or lifestyle, for example -- and if so, is there a way we can intervene to help others see similar benefits?"<br>
