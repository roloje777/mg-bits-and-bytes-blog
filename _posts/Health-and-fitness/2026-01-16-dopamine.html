      <hr />

      <h2>The Scene: University of Aveiro Cafeteria</h2>

      <p>
        The cafeteria buzzed with the usual lunchtime chaos — clinking cutlery,
        espresso machines hissing, and students arguing about exams.
      </p>

      <p>
        At a corner table sat <strong>Carmen</strong>, <strong>Daniel</strong>,
        and <strong>Nicole</strong>.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Carmen</strong> – Psychology major. South African accent,
          English-speaking, curious mind, parents from the UK and Spain.
          Observes people the way others observe sunsets.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Daniel</strong> – Sports Science major. Portuguese. Dream:
          coaching SLB Benfica one day. Eats like he trains.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Nicole</strong> – Biology major. Daniel’s sister. Sharp,
          analytical, and the unofficial fact-checker of the group.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>On the table:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>One <strong>francesinha</strong> (because this is Portugal)</li>
        <li>A plate of <strong>grilled chicken, rice, and salad</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Sopa do dia</strong></li>
        <li>Two <strong>galões</strong> and one espresso</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Their shared course?
        <em>“Effects of Activities and Environment on Human Behaviour.”</em
        ><br />
        Today’s topic: <strong>Dopamine</strong>.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>“So… What Even Is Dopamine?”</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Carmen</strong> leaned back. “Okay, psychologist version first:
        dopamine isn’t the ‘happy hormone’. It’s the
        <em>‘go get it’</em> chemical.”
      </p>   

      <p>
        <strong>Nicole</strong> nodded. “Biology agrees. It’s a
        neurotransmitter. Basically, a chemical messenger that helps brain cells
        talk to each other.”
      </p>
         <div class = "image-container">
        <img src="/assets/img/posts/dopamine_brain.png" alt="Nicole holding biology book up">
      </div>

      <p><strong>Daniel</strong> frowned. “So… it’s not happiness?”</p>

      <p>
        “Nope,” Carmen smiled. “It’s motivation. Wanting. Chasing.
        Anticipation.”
      </p>

      <p>Daniel stabbed his chicken. “So this francesinha gave me dopamine?”</p>

      <p>
        Nicole laughed. “Not exactly. Dopamine spikes more when you
        <em>expect</em> the francesinha than when you eat it.”
      </p>

      <p>Daniel froze. “That explains so much about my life.”</p>

      <hr />

      <h2>Where Dopamine Comes From (And Why Food Matters)</h2>

      <p>Nicole slipped into lecturer mode.</p>

      <p>
        “Your brain makes dopamine from an amino acid called
        <strong>tyrosine</strong>. You get it from protein.”
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Fish</li>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>Dairy</li>
        <li>Beans and lentils</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        “Then,” she continued, “tyrosine becomes <strong>L-DOPA</strong>, then
        dopamine. But it only works properly if you have enough iron, vitamin
        B6, folate, and vitamin C.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Carmen glanced at Daniel’s plate. “Congratulations. Your lunch is
        neurochemically responsible.”
      </p>

      <p>Daniel grinned. “Benfica coaches eat well.”</p>

      <hr />

      <h2>Dopamine in Real Life (AKA: Why You Check Your Phone)</h2>

      <p>
        “Dopamine fires when you finish a task,” Carmen said. “Or when you think
        you’re about to get something good.”
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Finishing assignments</li>
        <li>Exercise</li>
        <li>Learning something new</li>
        <li>Likes on Instagram</li>
        <li>Messages</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Nicole added, “The problem is overstimulation. Social media gives fast
        dopamine spikes. Then crashes.”
      </p>

      <p>Daniel sighed. “So scrolling TikTok at 2am is… bad?”</p>

      <p>“For your dopamine receptors?” Carmen replied sweetly. “Yes. Very.”</p>

      <hr />

      <h2>The Pros and Cons of Dopamine</h2>

      <h3>The Good</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Motivation</li>
        <li>Focus</li>
        <li>Learning</li>
        <li>Feeling rewarded for effort</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The Bad (When Unbalanced)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Addiction</li>
        <li>Impulsivity</li>
        <li>Low motivation when levels crash</li>
        <li>Difficulty enjoying simple things</li>
      </ul>

      <p>“Too little dopamine,” Nicole said, “looks like depression.”</p>

      <p>“Too much stimulation,” Carmen added, “looks like addiction.”</p>

      <p>Daniel blinked. “This course is personally attacking me.”</p>

      <hr />

      <h2>Exercise vs Meditation: The Ultimate Dopamine Debate</h2>

      <p>
        Daniel leaned forward. “Exercise boosts dopamine massively. Especially
        strength training.”
      </p>

      <p>“True,” said Carmen. “But meditation stabilizes it.”</p>

      <p>Nicole summed it up:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Exercise</strong>: Big dopamine release, motivation, energy
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Meditation</strong>: Small increase, better receptor
          sensitivity, fewer cravings
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        “Meditation even reduces cortisol,” Nicole added. “And stress blocks
        dopamine.”
      </p>

      <p>Daniel raised an eyebrow at Carmen. “You meditate?”</p>

      <p>She smiled. “Every day. Five minutes.”</p>

      <p>He paused. “Maybe you can teach me.”</p>

      <p>Nicole pretended not to notice the eye contact.</p>

      <hr />

      <h2>Why Meditation Actually Reduces Cravings</h2>

      <p>
        “Dopamine is about wanting,” Carmen explained. “Meditation trains you to
        notice the urge without acting on it.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Nicole nodded. “It strengthens the prefrontal cortex — self-control.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Daniel leaned back. “So instead of fighting cravings, you just… watch
        them?”
      </p>

      <p>“Exactly,” Carmen said. “And they lose power.”</p>

      <p>Daniel smiled. “That’s… kind of brilliant.”</p>

      <hr />

      <h2>The Real Dopamine Formula</h2>

      <p>Nicole wrote it on a napkin:</p>

      <p><strong>Effort + Meaning + Recovery = Healthy Dopamine</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li>Effort: exercise, studying, training</li>
        <li>Meaning: goals, values, purpose</li>
        <li>Recovery: sleep, meditation, calm</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Daniel folded the napkin carefully. “I’m keeping this.”</p>

      <p>Carmen smiled. “Good coaches understand brains.”</p>

      <hr />

      <h1>Dopamine, Deadlines & a Moment of Stillness</h1>

      <p>
        <em
          >Aveiro, Portugal — late afternoon. The cafeteria is starting to
          empty.</em
        >
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>“You Know What?” Carmen Said…</h2>

      <p>The plates were mostly empty now. Only coffee cups remained.</p>

      <p>
        Daniel leaned back in his chair, hands behind his head. “So basically,”
        he said, “my brain just wants me to chase rewards like a badly trained
        puppy.”
      </p>

      <p>Nicole rolled her eyes. “A scientifically accurate description.”</p>

      <p>
        Carmen smiled, stirring her galão. “You know… we’ve talked a lot about
        dopamine today.”
      </p>

      <p>She paused.</p>

      <p>“But dopamine isn’t fixed by talking about it.”</p>

      <p>Daniel raised an eyebrow. “Uh oh. This sounds like psychology.”</p>

      <p>“It is,” she laughed. “Come meditate with me.”</p>

      <p>Nicole blinked. “Now?”</p>

      <p>
        “Now,” Carmen said. “Before your phones steal all your dopamine again.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Daniel stood up. “If this helps me focus better at training tomorrow…
        I’m in.”

      <h2>Leaving the Noise Behind</h2>

      <p>
        They walked in comfortable silence, leaving the campus buildings behind.
      </p>

      <p>
        The path led them toward a quiet green area overlooking the hills — the
        kind of place students walk past without really noticing.
      </p>

      <p>Carmen stopped. “Here’s good.”</p>

      <!-- IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: The three characters arriving at a quiet nature spot -->
      <div class="image-container">        
         <img src="/assets/img//posts/arriving_for_meditation.png" alt="Image of Daniel, Carmen and Nicole walking to meditation site">
      </div>

      <p>They sat down.</p>

      <p>No textbooks. No phones. No deadlines.</p>

      <p>Just breath.</p>

      <hr />

      <h2>The Meditation</h2>

      <p>Carmen spoke softly.</p>

      <p>
        “Dopamine spikes when we’re always chasing the next thing. Meditation
        teaches the brain that it’s safe to stop.”
      </p>

      <p>Daniel closed his eyes. Nicole followed.</p>

      <p>For once, no one argued.</p>

      <!-- YOUTUBE MEDITATION PLACEHOLDER -->
      <div class="video-container2">

      <div class="image-container">
        <img src="/assets/img/posts/three_meditating.png" alt="Image of the three meditating">
      </div>

      <p>Time slowed.</p>

      <p>No notifications. No cravings. Just awareness.</p>

      <hr />

      <h2>After the Stillness</h2>

      <p>When they opened their eyes, the world felt… quieter.</p>

      <p>Nicole stretched. “Okay. I hate that this worked.”</p>

      <p>
        Daniel exhaled slowly. “I feel like my brain just stopped shouting at
        me.”
      </p>

      <p>Carmen smiled. “That’s balanced dopamine.”</p>

      <p>Daniel looked at her. “You should put that on a t-shirt.”</p>

      <p>She laughed.</p>

      <hr />

      <h2>Walking Toward the Sunset</h2>

      <p>
        The sun was already dipping low, painting the sky in gold and soft
        orange.
      </p>

      <p>They walked together, side by side.</p>

      <p>No rush.</p>

      <p>No need to fill the silence.</p>

      <!-- IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: The three characters walking toward the sunset -->
      <div class="image-container">
        <img src="/assets/img/posts/sunset.png" alt="Image of the three walking towards the sunset">
      </div>

      <p>Daniel broke the quiet.</p>

      <p>
        “You know,” he said, “if my players learned this… they’d train better.”
      </p>

      <p>Carmen glanced at him. “Good coaches understand the brain.”</p>

      <p>Nicole smirked. “I’m witnessing character development.”</p>

      <p>The sun slipped below the horizon.</p>

      <p>And for once, no one felt the urge to chase anything.</p>

      <hr />

      <h2>Final Takeaway</h2>

      <p>Dopamine isn’t about constant pleasure.</p>

      <p>It’s about progress, effort, anticipation, and balance.</p>

      <p>
        And sometimes… about a francesinha, good coffee, and a conversation that
        makes learning feel rewarding.
      </p>
