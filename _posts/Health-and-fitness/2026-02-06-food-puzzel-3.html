<p><em>Part 3 of the series: <strong>The Upside-Down Food Pyramid</strong></em></p>

<hr>

<h2>From Policy to Place</h2>

<p>In the previous post, we stepped back into post-war Europe and saw how nutrition policy was shaped by wartime logistics — calories, shelf life, and scale mattered more than biology.</p>

<p>But policy doesn’t exist in the abstract.</p>

<p>It lands somewhere.</p>

<p>In this post, we move from global thinking to a very specific place — Portugal, under Salazar — and beyond its borders, into its colonies.</p>

<p>Because if you want to see how food policy plays out in real life, you don’t need theory.</p>

<p>You need fields.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Still at the Pastelaria</h2>

<p>We’re still sitting at the <em>pastelaria</em>.</p>

<p>The coffees are half-finished now. The lunchtime crowd is starting to drift in.</p>

<p>I look at my wife and say, “Do you remember those stories you used to tell me about Mozambique?”</p>

<p>She nods immediately.</p>

<p>“My father’s rice farm,” she says. “I was very young, but I remember the fields. Endless rice.”</p>

<p>“And do you remember,” I continue, “how your cousin told us that in Portugal, everyone planted wheat?”</p>

<p>She pauses.</p>

<p>“Yes… olive trees, almonds, cherries — those came later.”</p>

<p>I lean back slightly.</p>

<p>“That wasn’t coincidence,” I say. “That was policy.”</p>

<hr>

<h2>Salazar’s Portugal: Feeding the Mainland</h2>

<p>Under António de Oliveira Salazar, Portugal pursued a vision of self-sufficiency.</p>

<p>Food security wasn’t just economic — it was political.</p>

<p>Wheat became the cornerstone of this strategy.</p>

<p>Through programs like the <em>Campanha do Trigo</em>, farmers across Portugal — including regions like Trás-os-Montes — were encouraged, and often pressured, to plant wheat.</p>

<p>Not because wheat was the most nutritious crop.</p>

<p>But because it was:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Storable</li>
  <li>Transportable</li>
  <li>Easy to centralise</li>
  <li>Politically controllable</li>
</ul>

<p>Diversity took a back seat.</p>

<p>Local crops gave way to national quotas.</p>

<p>Food became a matter of administration.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Trás-os-Montes: When Everyone Planted the Same Thing</h2>

<p>“My father planted wheat,” my wife’s cousin had said. “Everyone planted wheat.”</p>

<p>This wasn’t nostalgia.</p>

<p>It was structural reality.</p>

<p>Traditional polyculture — olives, fruit trees, legumes — slowly disappeared in favour of monoculture.</p>

<p>The goal wasn’t flavour, resilience, or nutrition.</p>

<p>The goal was yield.</p>

<p>Calories first.</p>

<p>Everything else later.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Mozambique: Rice for the Empire</h2>

<p>Portugal’s colonies played a different role.</p>

<p>While the mainland focused on wheat, Mozambique became a major producer of rice.</p>

<p>Rice thrived in the climate, stored well, and fit perfectly into the same carbohydrate-centric logic shaping global nutrition policy.</p>

<p>My wife’s memories weren’t unique.</p>

<p>Colonial agriculture was designed around export efficiency, not local dietary diversity.</p>

<p>Rice flowed outward.</p>

<p>Policy flowed downward.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Angola: Agriculture as Infrastructure</h2>

<p>Angola added another layer.</p>

<p>Its vast land and varied climate made it suitable for multiple crops — grains, coffee, sugar.</p>

<p>But again, the emphasis wasn’t nutritional richness.</p>

<p>It was economic reliability.</p>

<p>Colonies functioned as agricultural infrastructure — extensions of the mainland’s food security strategy.</p>

<p>Protein-rich local food systems were rarely prioritised.</p>

<p>Calories were easier to measure.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Exporting Food Security, Not Food Diversity</h2>

<p>This is the crucial point.</p>

<p>Portugal didn’t just export crops.</p>

<p>It exported a way of thinking about food.</p>

<p>A way that prioritised:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Grains over proteins</li>
  <li>Monoculture over diversity</li>
  <li>Stability over nutrition</li>
</ul>

<p>The same logic that shaped wartime rations shaped farms, trade routes, and eventually — plates.</p>

<p>What was grown determined what was eaten.</p>

<hr>

<h2>From Fields to Forks</h2>

<p>I look back at my wife.</p>

<p>“Wheat here. Rice there,” I say. “Different places, same idea.”</p>

<p>She nods slowly.</p>

<p>“And now,” she says, “we wonder why our diets are built around bread, pasta, and rice.”</p>

<p>Exactly.</p>

<p>These policies didn’t stay on farms.</p>

<p>They landed squarely on our plates.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Coming Up Next</h2>

<p>In the next post, we’ll follow those crops all the way into the modern food pyramid — and look at how a carbohydrate-centric model became official dietary advice.</p>

<hr>

<h2>My Perspective</h2>

<p>As an accredited <strong>CPD Fitness, Health, Nutrition, and Wellness Coach</strong>, I see how historical food systems still shape modern health outcomes.</p>

<p>Understanding this history isn’t about assigning blame to farmers, families, or cultures.</p>

<p>It’s about recognising that many of our “normal” eating patterns were engineered for food security — not metabolic health.</p>

<p>Once we understand that, we can start asking better questions about how we eat today.</p>
