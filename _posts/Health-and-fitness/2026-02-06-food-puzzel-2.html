      <h2>Picking Up Where We Left Off</h2>

      <p>
        In the previous post, I shared how a simple coffee conversation led me
        down a much deeper rabbit hole — one that connected childhood diabetes,
        protein intake, wheat fields in Portugal, and rice farms in Mozambique.
      </p>

      <p>We ended with a question:</p>

      <p>
        <strong
          >What if the food pyramid was never meant to make us
          healthier?</strong
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        In this post, we zoom out — away from the café table — and rewind to the
        moment when modern nutrition policy was born.
      </p>

      <p>Not in a laboratory.</p>

      <p>Not in a hospital.</p>

      <p>But in the middle of a world at war.</p>

      <hr />

      <h2>The Coffee Arrives — and the Explanation Continues</h2>

      <p>The waitress returns with our drinks.</p>

      <p>A <em>bica</em> for my wife. A <em>galão</em> for me.</p>

      <p>
        So,” she says, stirring her coffee, “you were saying this all started
        after the war?”
      </p>

      <p>“Exactly,” I reply. “And once you see it, it’s hard to unsee.”</p>

      <p>I take a sip and continue.</p>

      <p>
        “During the Second World War, governments weren’t asking how to optimise
        health. They were asking something far more basic.”
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong
          >How do we feed millions of people — cheaply, predictably, and at
          scale?</strong
        >
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>WWII Logistics: Calories First, Biology Later</h2>

      <p>
        World War II forced governments to think about food in entirely new
        ways.
      </p>

      <p>
        Millions of soldiers were deployed overseas. Entire civilian populations
        were under rationing. Supply chains were fragile. Spoilage was a real
        threat.
      </p>

      <p>The priority wasn’t optimal nutrition.</p>

      <p>The priority was:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Calories per unit of cost</li>
        <li>Shelf stability</li>
        <li>Ease of transport and storage</li>
        <li>Predictable production</li>
      </ul>

      <p>From a logistical standpoint, carbohydrates were unbeatable.</p>

      <p>
        Grains could be dried, stored, shipped, and portioned with minimal loss.
        Wheat, rice, corn, and sugar delivered energy reliably — and cheaply.
      </p>

      <p>
        Protein and fat, on the other hand, were expensive, perishable, and
        harder to manage at scale.
      </p>

      <p>So the system did what systems do.</p>

      <p>It optimised for survival.</p>

      <hr />

      <h2>Rations, Not Recommendations</h2>

      <p>Early nutrition guidelines were not lifestyle advice.</p>

      <p>They were rationing tools.</p>

      <p>They answered questions like:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>How many calories does a soldier need to keep fighting?</li>
        <li>How little protein prevents visible deficiency?</li>
        <li>What foods can be standardised across populations?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This is where the now-famous
        <strong>0.8 grams of protein per kilogram</strong> originates — not as
        an optimal target, but as a bare minimum to prevent deficiency in young,
        active men.
      </p>

      <p>It was never designed for:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Aging populations</li>
        <li>Sedentary lifestyles</li>
        <li>Metabolic disease</li>
        <li>Muscle preservation</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        But once written into policy, numbers have a way of sticking around.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>The Birth of Population-Level Nutrition</h2>

      <p>After the war, governments didn’t abandon these frameworks.</p>

      <p>They institutionalised them.</p>

      <p>
        Nutrition moved from emergency logistics into public policy — school
        lunches, hospitals, military food systems, and eventually national
        dietary guidelines.
      </p>

      <p>The focus remained the same:</p>

      <p><strong>Feed the population efficiently.</strong></p>

      <p>Not:</p>

      <p><strong>Optimise individual health.</strong></p>

      <p>This distinction matters more than most people realise.</p>

      <hr />

      <h2>Why Carbohydrates Won — Politically</h2>

      <p>Carbohydrates didn’t just win because they were practical.</p>

      <p>They won because they aligned with:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Agricultural subsidies</li>
        <li>Industrial food production</li>
        <li>Post-war economic rebuilding</li>
        <li>Centralised planning</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Grain-based systems could be scaled, controlled, and measured.</p>

      <p>
        Protein — especially animal protein — was messy. Variable. Local. Harder
        to standardise.
      </p>

      <p>So the food pyramid emerged not from biology, but from bureaucracy.</p>

      <p>
        A neat diagram that reflected policy priorities, not human physiology.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>The Long Shadow of Wartime Thinking</h2>

      <p>
        What began as a wartime necessity slowly transformed into nutritional
        dogma.
      </p>

      <p>Calories became king.</p>

      <p>Carbohydrates became the base.</p>

      <p>Protein became something to “add later.”</p>

      <p>And fat? Something to fear.</p>

      <p>
        The result is a framework that made sense in 1945 — but looks
        increasingly out of place in a world facing obesity, diabetes, and
        muscle loss.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>Coming Up Next</h2>

      <p>
        <strong
          >But nowhere was this policy more visible than in Portugal — and its
          colonies.</strong
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        In the next post, we’ll look at how post-war nutrition logic played out
        on real land, with real crops, under real political systems — from wheat
        fields in Trás-os-Montes to rice farms in Mozambique.

      <h2>My Perspective</h2>

      <p>
        As an accredited
        <strong>CPD Fitness, Health, Nutrition, and Wellness Coach</strong>, I
        see the downstream effects of these policies every day.
      </p>

      <p>
        Guidelines designed for population survival are still being treated as
        blueprints for individual health — despite living in a completely
        different metabolic reality.
      </p>

      <p>Understanding where these ideas came from is not about blame.</p>

      <p>
        It’s about recognising when a system has outlived its original purpose.
      </p>
