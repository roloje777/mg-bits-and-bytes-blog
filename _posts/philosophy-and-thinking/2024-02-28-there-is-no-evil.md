### Democracy and evil

A democracy exists whenever those who are free and are not well off, being in a majority, are in sovereign control of the government, an oligarchy when control lies in the hands of the rich and better born, these being few.<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle">Aristotle</a>

> ..now have you ever wondered?  
> We live in a democracy, so we live in a just and fair world.  
> Yes, we vote for those that implement laws that are just for all of us....  
> Thus, are our laws ethical to all, man, animals, and nature?  
> Yet, it is true that the majority of voters are poor and of a lower class, yet those in government are rich and of a higher class.  
> Is democracy  a basic pillar of oligarchy and elite-rule, where evil is committed with the voters blessings?

> A british economists Cockshott and Cottrell stated the following..  
> <i>Parliamentary government and democracy are polar opposites.  
> Democracy is rule by the masses, by the poor and dispossessed; parliament, rule by professional politicians, who, in numbers and class position, are part of the oligarchy.</i>
> Are we really in control of our future in A democracy?

<strong>as the deck is stacked, the pseudo-options are predetermined by parties — and, what’s more, they’re empty.</strong>

### The banality of evil by Hannah Arendt

She followed the trail of Adolf Eichmmann, in Jerusalem, who was kidnapped by the Israeli secret services in Argentina, in 1960, to stand trial.  
[Adolf Eichmmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Eichmann) was a German-Austrian official in the Nazy Party and an officer of SS.

In her book <strong>Eichmann em Jerusalém,</strong> the philosopher argues that as a result of the massification of society, a crowd has been created that is incapable of making moral judgments, which is why they accept and follow orders without question.

Eichmann, one of those responsible for the final solution, is not seen as a monster, but just as a zealous employee who was unable to resist the orders he received. Evil thus becomes banal.  
[A banalidade do mal de Hannah Arendt](https://ensina.rtp.pt/artigo/a-banalidade-do-mal-de-hannah-arendt/)

<i>"Evil comes from a failure to think.  
It defies thought for as soon as thought tries to engage itself with evil and examine the premises and principles from which it originates, it is frustrated because it finds nothing there.  
That is the banality of evil." </i>  
[Hannah Arendt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Arendt)

> Evil may not only be done by evil people or forces, but by common people doing their everyday work, such as:
>
> - a soldier following orders
> - a politician implementing policy
> - a teacher using a teaching guideline
> - a doctor issuing prescribed medicine.
> - a person voting for the same party over and over again, even though their promises are just that, promises.
