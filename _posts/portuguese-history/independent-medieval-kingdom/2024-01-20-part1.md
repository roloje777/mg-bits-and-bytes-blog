    <p>Fascinating History of Portugal's First King: D. Afonso Henriques</p>
</div>

The appearance of Portugal was sudden and can be explained by the short-term political development influenced by the Christian Reconquista.

The kings of Asturias and León faced the problem of keeping their territories under their firm control. Portucale and Coimbra were especially troublesome, as they bordered Muslim al-Andalus.

León-Castile's King became aware of the ever-growing autonomy of Portucale and Coimbra and, in the mid-11th century, started reasserting their authority in these regions.  
They replaced the counts with the king’s loyal supporters.  
The count of Portucale refused, and in 1071, he organized a revolt.  
He was defeated and killed by King García of León-Castile.  
This ended the control of Portucale by the family of Vı́mara Peres that lasted for two centuries.

Alfonso VI appointed Raymond of Burgundy as the governor of Galicia, a foreigner with no family ties to the region, making him a perfect candidate, as he would be more likely to remain loyal to the king.  
He was tied to Burgundy through a marriage with the sister of the duke of Burgundy. Raymond came to León-Castile to take part in the Reconquista, the king noticed his efforts and gave him the hand of his only legitimate daughter, Urraca.

Another Burgundian noble appeared at the court of Alfonso VI: Henry of Burgundy, who would prove crucial for the foundation of the Kingdom of Portugal.  
He married Raymond’s sister, binding the two noble families together.  
Alfonso split ancient Gallaecia along the flow of the Minho River. Raymond took control over Galicia, while Henry received the Portucale-Coimbra territory, also known as Condado Portucalense.

  </div>
<i>Condado Portucalense (868 - 1143) was a county that emerged during the process of reconquest of the Iberian peninsula by Christians and was dissolved with the signing of the Treaty of Zamora . From this name comes the current Portugal , because during the High Middle Ages the current Portuguese North Region was called Portucalense County, to differentiate it from the Kingdom of Galicia.  
There were, in the current territory of Portugal , during the reconquest process , two governments called Condado Portucalense or Portucale County . </i>

<i>In contemporary documents, the territory was called Portugália, being the county founded by Vímara Peres in 868, after the presury of the Moors of Portucale ( Porto ). From the end of the 10th century and with Gonçalo Mendes , the Portuguese counts began to use the title of dukes, which could indicate greater importance and greater territorial extension.</i>

The combination of Portucale and Coimbra into a single administrative unit was a crucial step for the later formation of Portugal.
Earl Henry was a loyal servant of León-Castile.
He married Alfonso’s bastard daughter Teresa.

After the death of Alfonso VI in 1109, Henry took the opportunity of the ensuing civil war and quietly retreated to his earldom and govern it as a true autonomous ruler in his own right.
He abandoned his feudal obligations to the crown.

Henry died in 1112, and he left his earldom to his wife Teresa,their son, Afonso Henriques (r. 1139–1185), was still a minor.
Being a woman,the clergy and nobles pressured her to remarry.
The Trava family of Galicia insisted that Henry’s widow should marry one of them.

The Trava family’s main goal was the reunification of the Galicia and Portugal- Coimbra regions into an independent kingdom.

She married her daughter to a Trava, and she even later became involved in a love affair with Fernando Pérez de Trava, the son of Pedro Fróilaz. Even though they were never married, Fernando started governing Portucale.
As a result, the nobles and bishops of Portucale- Coimbra left Teresa’s court.
In 1127, a rebellion started against the rule of Fernando Pérez de Trava and Teresa.
They were led by Teresa’s son, Afonso Henriques.

The most notable relationship Afonso had was with the Mendes family, whose members were responsible for his education and upbringing.
The Mendes family took him to the Zamora Cathedral, where he was knighted.

The decisive battle between the forces of Afonso and his mother Teresa took place on June 24th, 1128, at São Mamede.
Afonso defeated and expelled the Travas, and Teresa withdrew to Galicia with them.
