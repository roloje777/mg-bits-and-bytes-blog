It is told that in the 8th to 9th century an arab monarch from Córdoba instituted a law that 100 maidens had to be handed over yearly to his kingdom, to serve as slaves, for their pleasure or even wives.
This was known as the <strong>tribute of the hundred maidens.</strong>

A young maiden known as Sancha or Mécia and five of her colleagues had been selected.  
On their way they rested under a fig tree.  
A young Knight on horse back appeared and asked where they were going.  
On hearing their story he promised to save them from their ordeal.

He fought the Moors and when his sword broke, he broke a branch from the fig tree, using it as a weapon and defeated his opponents, thus freeing the six young maidens from their ordeal.

This Knight was called Guesto Ansures and he married the young lady Sancha.

There is even a song that is believed to have be written by this same brave Knight.  
Here's the first verse...

> No figueiral figueiredo,  
> Lá no figueiral entrei;  
> Seis donzelas encontrara,  
> Seis donzelas encontrei;  
> Para elas caminhara,  
> Para elas caminhei;  
> Chorando a todas achara,  
> A todas chorando achei;  
> Logo ali lhes perguntara,  
> Logo ali lhes perguntei;  
> Quem foi que ousou maltratá-las,  
> Tratá-las de tão má lei?
