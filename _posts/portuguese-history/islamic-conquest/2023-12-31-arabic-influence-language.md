The Portuguese language derives from Latin dialects that were spoken by soldiers of the Roman Empire during the occupation of the Iberian Peninsula.
From those dialects emerged the so-called "latim vulgar" and later today's Portuguese. However, the roots of Portuguese can not only be found in the Latin language. In this article we'll talk about the Arabic influences.

The Moorish Invasion began in 711 and did not end until the end of the 15th century. The Moors lived in today's region of Morocco and Western Algeria. They converted to Islam after contact with Arabs from the Middle East who were spreading the word of their prophet Mohammed.

The Moors left a considerable cultural heritage on the Iberian Peninsula, especially as they had been the scientific pioneers of their era. Many Arabic words have been adapted in the Portuguese language due to the fact that it had been the Moors who introduced certain knowledge, customs, objects and techniques and there were no corresponding words in Portuguese.

....
Most people don't know about the Arabic origin of words as they have been in the Portuguese vocabulary since the Middle Ages. At the same time, immigrants from Syria or Lebanon have difficulties recognizing Arabic words due to the strong phonetic changes over time.

In the Portuguese, the words from Arabic roots are more than one thousand.
Here are some examples:

- Acerola (Az zurura): Literally means "from the bushes". Very popular fruit in Brazil.
- Assassino (Hashashim): The "hashish smoker". It comes from the Order of the Assassins of Alamut, a terrorist organisation in the MIddle Ages, whose members killed both the crusaders and sarracens. In English it is "Assassin"
- A√ß√∫car (As-Suqar): The pronounciation is the same in both languages. It means sugar, and in Arabic means literraly "small stone".
- √Ålcool (Al-Kuhul): "Metallic powder". Alcohol is present in many things, including your beer.
- Bairro (Al-Barri): Divisions within a city (Neighborhood in English).
- Cabide (Al-Qabbid): The clotheshanger means literally "something that hangs tight".
- Marfim ('Asm al-Fil): The word for Ivory means in Arabic "Elephant's bone".
- Mesquinho (Al-Miskin): Poor in Arabic was passed on to Portuguese as a person who doesn't like to share a thing, and it's very selfish.
- G√™nio (Al-Jinn): In Arabic Folklore and Tradition, it is an entity superior than humans, but inferior to the angels. The word for g√™nio in English is genius
- Sof√° (Al-Suffat): Sofa means literally "large bench".
- Alf√¢ndega (al-fundaq) "hospedaria", "estalagem"
