The increased demand for pottery and copper products led the early Portuguese societies to reach out and form relations with people elsewhere in Europe.  
They soon developed a vast network of trade across western Europe.  
Estremadura was particularly developed, probably because it was a central location with a developed river system that served as a trade route to many communities.  
Estremadura was also a very fertile region, and it soon began providing food to the rather dry areas of Portugal.

In the Bronze Age, they started erecting hilltop fortresses, known as castros, but it remains unknown who exactly built them.

Evidence from burial sites shows that certain people were buried with ornamental weapons and jewelry, which is clearly a sign of prestige.  
The likely answer is that the early social elite in Portugal was composed of warrior leaders who were able to control the production and distribution of copper goods.  
There are various stelae found in Portugal dating from the Bronze Age, and they depict warriors and the various weapons they used, such as bows, daggers, and halberds. Even the funerary lids were engraved with similar images, and these are dated to 1200 BCE.

The burial sites also show a transition in the belief system of the early societies in Portugal.

  </div>

While the Neolithic people worshiped the bull’s head and various phallic menhirs (tall, upright stones), the Copper and Bronze Age people prayed to mysterious eye-idols, which were often engraved on rocks, bones, or wood.  
They were also often painted on ceramic pottery. Scholars believe these idols were connected with solar or stellar symbols and represented the Mother Goddess.

Iron arrived in Portugal through two routes: the Phoenician traders from the Mediterranean coast and the Celts from the northern parts of Europe.  
The earliest iron item discovered in Portugal was dated to 700 BCE, and it is a dagger with a bronze handle.  
Iron was stronger than bronze and could be easily shaped and sharpened.  
Thus, it is no wonder it rapidly entered regular use.

Portugal was rich in iron mines, and the iron industry developed quickly.  
The Iron Age brought another change within Portugal: the first inscriptions.  
They were found in funerary stelae dated to the late 7th and early 5th centuries BCE.  
The inscriptions were found only on the graves belonging to the elite, as well as on some coins and pottery.  
But the language and the script have yet to be deciphered.  
It is believed that the language belonged to the indigenous people that the Romans called Conii, and the script might have been derived from the Phoenician one.

    <p style="margin:0;padding:0px">Iron Age</p>
  </div>
During the Iron Age, the territory of the Iberian Peninsula received waves of immigrants from the north.  
They were not all Celts, but most of them were. They brought with them a new culture, religion, social organization, and artistic expressions.

They had a reputation of being fearsome warriors and excellent horsemen.  
During the 1st millennium BCE, they spread throughout Europe from Ireland and reached as far as the shores of the Black Sea.  
They came to Portugal in two waves; the first one occurred in the 6th and 5th centuries BCE, and the second one happened in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th centuries CE

Strabo thought that the Celts were wise and kind and that they had an important cultural influence on the region.

    <p style="margin:0;padding:0px">clans</p>
  </div>
The society of Iron Age Portugal was based on kinship, and there were no kingdoms yet.  
Family alliances dominated, and they were reinforced by marriages.  
The groups of allied families formed clans.    
It seems that each clan occupied territory around a certain castro, and together, they supervised the distribution of their land.

### 700 and 550 BCE,

The society was no longer simple, and herding and agriculture were replaced with the growing industrialization that erupted with the opening of many iron mines.

    <p style="margin:0;padding:0px">wheel-made pottery</p>
  </div>
The use of iron became widespread, and pottery was no longer handmade but wheel-made.  
The settlements were no longer villages but oppida, large fortified towns.  
The artistic tradition evolved and developed into new forms, and writing was introduced.
On top of this, new religious cults appeared.  
<strong>All of these developments are now referred to as Orientalization because they were all inspired by the ideas, technologies, and attitudes from the Mediterranean.</strong>

    <p style="margin:0;padding:0px">Phoenician Traders</p>
  </div>
The western Mediterranean was regularly visited by the Phoenician traders from Tyre and Sidon. During the 8th century, these visits intensified because the Phoenicians were searching for new sources of raw materials and markets.  
Their main merchandise was perfumes, glass, ornaments, furniture, pottery, wine, and oil.
They acquired raw materials from Portugal, such as iron and purple dye, which were highly valued.

    <p style="margin:0;padding:0px">Goddess Astarte</p>
  </div>
The Near Eastern practices of cremation and rites of worshiping the Phoenician fertility goddess Astarte entered Algarve through these trade routes.

During the 3rd century BCE, the Barcid family took control of Carthage and changed the character of the relationship with Iberia from trade to conquest.  
Southern Portugal became part of the newly established Iberian Empire, and Carthaginian-styled towns started popping up throughout Portugal, even as far as the mouth of the Tagus where Lisbon lies.

    <p style="margin:0;padding:0px">Hannibal Barca</p>
  </div>
The famous Hannibal Barca (247–183/181 BCE) founded a Carthaginian settlement in the Algarve region, probably somewhere near today’s Portimão.  
Its presence is known to us because it was described by the Romans, who called this settlement Portus Hannibalis.

But the most spectacular Carthaginian site in Portugal has to be Garvão in Baixo Alentejo, which was a religious sanctuary dedicated to Tanit, a Carthaginian fertility goddess.
