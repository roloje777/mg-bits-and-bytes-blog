> I know it's going to be a good day when Figo, my 17 year old cat, is feeling rather energetic after having his bla - soft food.  
> Now days, as it's winter as we'll, I mush his food with some hot water, making it rather like a soup.  
> The old man, as I'm told he is over 85 human years, gets these fits of energy and plays "pick-a-boo", running down the passage and expecting me to run after him as he tries to hide.  
> Now, his furry tail, usually sticking out from the under furniture, gives up his hiding place ðŸ˜‚, and as I approach, off he dashes looking for another...  
> This led me to look up a song with the lyrics [it's a good day](https://youtu.be/n0RsNH7le4Q?si=aOB17drq16bAiXxs).
