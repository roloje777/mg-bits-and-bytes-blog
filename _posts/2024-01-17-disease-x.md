Disease X is a placeholder name that was adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO) in February 2018 on their shortlist of blueprint priority diseases to represent a hypothetical, unknown pathogen that could cause a future epidemic.

> How does one prepare for the unknown?  
> Well, I googled it, and here is one of many replies ..

<dfn>
Yes, it sounds counter-intuitive, but the first step to dealing with the unknown is to embrace it. Accept that there will be things that you can't control and focus on what you can. Remember that uncertainty is a natural part of entrepreneurship, and it's what makes it exciting and challenging.  
</dfn>

> Now, according to the WHO, you get 300 or so scientists and develop a vaccine for the unknown.  
> I know what can prepare one to respond to unknown circumstances. What I mean mentally, physically, and probably resources as well, but to develop something tangible for the unknown, well that I thought was not possible.. I may yet be proven wrong ... ü§î  
> Or do we just go on blaming the other animals that share the planet with us, and ignore the fact that we are the sole reason for their extinction since the last ice age if not longer ?  
> üí° now the biggest challenge may not be to prepare for the unknown future, but to gain the trust of it's people

Many species have become extinct because of human activities such as hunting, overharvesting, the conversion of natural ecosystems to cropland and urban areas, pollution, and other alternations or destruction of natural environments.The current rates of human-induced extinctions are estimated to be about 1,000 to 10,000 times greater than past natural (background) rates of extinction.

### Preparing for Disease X

With fresh warnings from the World Health Organization that an unknown <strong>Disease X</strong> could result in 20 times more fatalities than the coronavirus pandemic, what novel efforts are needed to prepare healthcare systems for the multiple challenges ahead?

This session is linked to the Partnership for Health System Sustainability and Resilience and the Collaborative Surveillance Initiative of the World Economic Forum.

### What Is ‚ÄòDisease X‚Äô? Right-Wing Circles Slam Hypothetical Pandemic

With less than a week until the World Economic Forum discusses potential preparations for a hypothetical disease far deadlier than Covid-19 named ‚ÄúDisease X,‚Äù mention of the illness have sparked a firestorm on social media, <strong>with right-wing accounts slamming the plans surrounding the hypothetical situation.</strong>

<strong>Disease X, a hypothetical unknown threat, is the name used among scientists to encourage the development of countermeasures, including vaccines and tests, to deploy in the case of a future outbreak
</strong> ‚Äî the WHO convened a group of over 300 scientists in November 2022 to study the ‚Äúunknown pathogen that could cause a serious international epidemic, positing a mortality rate 20 times that of Covid-19.

<strong>The next Disease X could appear at any time, and the world needs to be better prepared.</strong>

The newly established World Health Organization (WHO) Scientific Advisory Group on the Origins of Novel Pathogens (SAGO) .... Its mandate is to advise the WHO on developing a framework to define comprehensive studies on the origins of such pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2‚Äîinformation that is essential for developing policies and enhancing preparedness to reduce developing policies and enhancing preparedness to reduce the possibility of future zoonotic spillover events <strong>(transmission of a pathogen from animals to humans) </strong> and the chance that those events become major outbreaks.

All hypotheses must continue to be examined and, as WHO has said from the outset, <strong>a fully open and transparent scientific process is essential</strong>.

Recent findings on the potential for zoonotic spillover of SARS-CoV-2 to humans, either directly from bats or through other animals, include, but are not limited to, studies of wildlife sold in markets in and around Wuhan, China (where cases of COVID-19 were first reported in December 2019); studies of SARS-like coronaviruses circulating in bats in China and Southeast Asia; studies on prepandemic biological sampling around the world; and other animal susceptibility studies. <strong>However, detailed investigations of the earliest known and suspected cases in China prior to December 2019 are still urgently needed, including analyses of stored blood samples from 2019 in Wuhan and surrounding areas and retrospective searches of hospital and mortality data for earlier cases.</strong>

COVID-19 will not be the last Disease X. We need scientific collaboration, data sharing, and implementation of a robust ‚Äúone health‚Äù approach that brings together the human, animal, and environmental spheres to boost risk identification, reduction, and surveillance in animals and at the human-animal-environment interface.

Globally, at least 4.8 million people have died from COVID-19. <strong>They and their families are owed answers as to where and how the virus originated. It‚Äôs in everyone‚Äôs interest to better prepare for the next Disease X.</strong>
