At some point in late 2022, the eight billionth human being will enter the world, ushering in a new milestone for humanity.  
In just 48 years, the world population has doubled in size, jumping from four to eight billion. Of course, humans are not equally spread throughout the planet, and countries take all shapes and sizes. The visualizations in this article aim to build context on how the eight billion people are distributed around the world.

As of 2022, Africaâ€™s total population stands at 1.4 billion people. Many of the countries with the fastest growth rates are located in Africa and by 2050, the population of the continent is expected to jump to 2.5 billion.  
Nigeria is Africaâ€™s most populous country and its largest economy. Based on current growth rates, Nigeriaâ€™s largest city, Lagos, could even emerge as the worldâ€™s top megacity by the end of the century.  
Africa has by far the lowest median age of any of the other continents.

<dfn>The [median](https://www.who.int/data/gho/indicator-metadata-registry/imr-details/116) age is the age at the midpoint of the population. Half of the population is older than the median age and half of the population is younger.</dfn>

With 4.7 billion people in 2022, Asia is by far the worldâ€™s most populous region.  
The continent is dominated by the two massive population centers of China and India.  
In 2023, a big shift will occur, with India surpassing China to become the worldâ€™s most populous country.

Europeâ€™s population in 2022 is 750 million peopleâ€”more than twice the size of the United States.  
A century ago, Europeâ€™s population was close to 30% of the world total. Today, that figure stands at less than 10%. This is, in part, due to population growth throughout other regions of the world.
Russia remains Europeâ€™s largest country by population.

North Americaâ€™s population is 602 million people as of 2022.
The continent is dominated by the United States, which makes up more than half of the total population.  
Americaâ€™s population is still growing modestly (by global standards), but perhaps more interesting are the
internal migration patterns that are occurring. States like Texas and Florida are seeing an influx from other states.
Canada has one of the highest population growth rates of major developed economies thanks to international migration.

The population of South America in 2022 is 439 million. Brazil makes up nearly half of that total.

The population of the Oceania region is 44 million peopleâ€”just slightly higher than the population of California.  
...many of the smallest countries by population can also be found in this region.

The next global population milestoneâ€”nine billionâ€”will likely be hit sometime in the 2030s.
