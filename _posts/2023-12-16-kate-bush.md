Kate starting writing songs at the age of 11.
She was inspired by Elton John, Frank Zappa among others and inspired artists like Lady Gagga.
Catherine Bush was born 30 July 1958 is an English singer, songwriter, record producer and dancer.
During the early 1970s, Lindsay Kemp was a popular and inspirational teacher of dance and mime.
David Bowie, Kate Bush and Vivian Stanshall were students of Kemp.
She studied violin and piano at school and specialises in art rock.

## Wuthering Heights

Bush wrote the song aged 18, within a few hours late at night on 5 March 1977. She was inspired after seeing the 1967 BBC adaptation of the 1847 novel Wuthering Heights. She then read the book and also discovered that she shared her birthday with author Emily Brontë.

It peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart for four weeks, making Bush the first female artist to achieve a number-one single with an entirely self-penned song.

## Kate Bush by Pink Floyd

Achieving a dream that was once set thanks to a kind invite from David Gilmour and Pink Floyd, the band helped a teenage Bush imagine bigger and better things for herself that she’d one day make happen.

While the world didn’t hear Kate Bush’s unique voice until she was 19, the singer had been working on it since childhood. By 15, she had amassed over 50 songs. With the help of her family, a self-made demo tape ended up in the hands of Pink Floyd’s David Gilmour, and the rest was history.

He was so impressed, in fact, that Gilmour himself paid for Bush to go and record a more professional track, leading to her being signed to EMI.

Gilmour, it would seem, took Bush on as something of protégé. He saw so considerable promise, even when record labels doubted her.

When Kate Bush sat in on Pink Floyd’s recording sessions: “I was absolutely staggered”

To a teenage Kate Bush, the studio seemed like a dream: “I really thought I would never be able to record in a place like Abbey Road.”

### Lyrics

Out on the wiley, windy moors
We'd roll and fall in green
You had a temper like my jealousy
Too hot, too greedy
How could you leave me
When I needed to possess you?
I hated you, I loved you, too

Bad dreams in the night
They told me I was going to lose the fight
Leave behind my Wuthering, Wuthering
Wuthering Heights

Heathcliff, it's me, I'm Cathy
I've come home, I'm so cold
Let me in your window

Heathcliff, it's me, I'm Cathy
I've come home, I'm so cold
Let me in your window

Ooh, it gets dark, it gets lonely
On the other side from you
I pine a lot, I find the lot
Falls through without you
I'm coming back, love
Cruel Heathcliff, my one dream
My only master

Too long I roam in the night
I'm coming back to his side, to put it right
I'm coming home to Wuthering, Wuthering
Wuthering Heights

Heathcliff, it's me, I'm Cathy
I've come home, I'm so cold
Let me in your window

Heathcliff, it's me, I'm Cathy
I've come home, I'm so cold
Let me in your window

Ooh, let me have it
Let me grab your soul away
Ooh, let me have it
Let me grab your soul away
You know it's me, Cathy

Heathcliff, it's me, I'm Cathy
I've come home, I'm so cold
Let me in your window

Heathcliff, it's me, I'm Cathy
I've come home, I'm so cold
Let me in your window

Heathcliff, it's me, I'm Cathy
I've come home, I'm so cold
