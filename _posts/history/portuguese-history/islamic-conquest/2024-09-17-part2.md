<h2>The Islamic Rule of Iberia</h2>

<details><summary>Al-Andalus designated the western part of the conquered peninsula, which mostly consisted of today‚Äôs territory of Portugal.<br>
Now <span class="my-p">Al-Andulas</span> was basically the Iberian Peninsula.<br>
During the early stage of the Islamic rule, Gallaecia wasn‚Äôt part of Gharb al-Andalusia, as the area wasn‚Äôt attractive to the Umayyad settlers.<br>
They preferred the southern and central regions of Roman Lusitania since the climate there was warmer and drier, already well-developed, and close to C√≥rdoba, a major Islamic center.

The toponym ‚Äúal-Andalus‚Äù is used by modern-day scholars to designate the Muslim rule of the Iberian Peninsula.<br>
However, the term itself is dated to the 8th century, as it was inscribed on coins minted in 716.<br>
It is the name the Muslims gave to their newly conquered territory.<br>

<h3>The independent Umayyad state</h3>
<p>
The Umayyad caliphs were overthrown in 740 and replaced by the Persian Abbasids, who had their capital in Baghdad.<br>
They proved to be more distant from Iberia, which made al-Andalus a perfect place for a surviving Umayyad prince to escape to.<br>

</div>
<p>
He was known as Abd al-Rahman I (731‚Äì788), and he proclaimed the peninsula to be an independent Umayyad state and himself as its emir.
</p>
<p>
The emirs of C√≥rdoba proved to be able rulers, with a few exceptions, until the 10th century.

<h3>Rahman III</h3>

<p>
Abd al-Rahman III (r. 912‚Äì961) assumed the title of caliph.<br>
He made C√≥rdoba a magnificent city, with its imposing but stylish palaces and mosques.<br>
As he was a great patron of the arts and education, Rahman III was praised throughout Europe, and his court was proclaimed to be the most sophisticated on the continent.<br>
His reign and the reign of his successor, al-Hakam II (r. 961‚Äì976), were proclaimed to be a period of peace and prosperity in al-Andalus.<br>

<h3>Arabic influence on local language</h3>
<p>
All villages were soon named aldeia, and the word entered the modern Portuguese language. Al- Andalus was subjected to raids by the northern Christians and seafaring Vikings, and the government had to install defensive marches in their frontier regions.

Each city had an inner fortification or a citadel (alc√°√ßova), which contained a water cistern, food storage, and administrative buildings, as well as the houses of the military leaders and city officials.<br>
The frontier cities that were under constant threat of attack had much bigger alc√°√ßovas than the cities in inner al-Andalus, which were considered to be safe.<br>

 He succeeded to the Caliphate after the death of his father Abd-ar-Rahman III in 961.<br>
 He secured peace with the Catholic kingdoms of northern Iberia, and made use of the stability to develop agriculture through the construction of irrigation works.<br>
 Economic development was also encouraged through the widening of streets and the building of markets.<br>
</p>
<p>
Hakam himself was very well versed in numerous sciences. <br>
His personal library was of enormous proportions.<br>
Some accounts speak of him having more than 600,000 books.<br>

<p>
Al-Hakam II suffered a stroke near the end of his life that curtailed his activities and may explain why he was unable to properly prepare his son for leadership.<br>

<h3>Manipulating the young Caliph</h3>
<p>
Al-Hakam II was the last prominent ruler of the Umayyad al-Andalus, and his successors rapidly lost their fortunes.<br>
Al-Hakam was succeeded by his son (Hashim 11), <strong>who was only twelve years old.</strong><br>
Thus, his chief-minister al-Mansur took the opportunity to manipulate the young caliph.<br>
Al-Mansur became a ruthless tyrant who remained in power from 980 until 1002.<br>
Nevertheless, he was an exceptional military commander who managed to defend al-Andalus from invaders from the Christian north.

<blockquote>
This reminds of a young boy that became king at around eight years old.<br>

Now <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah">Josiah</a> became the 16th king of Judah ruling around 640 to 609 years before Christ was born.(640‚Äì609 BCE).<br>
Josiah ordered the High Priest Hilkiah to use tax money to renovate the temple.<br>
While Hilkiah was clearing the treasure room of the Temple he discovered a scroll described in 2 Kings as "the book of the Law".(Laws of Moses)<br>
It is said that the priest gave this scroll to Shaphan, the kings secretary, who in turn read it to the the young king.<br>
On hearing this, <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/compare/2CH.34.1-25">he tore his clothes.</a><br>

According to the Bible, King Josiah then changed his form of leadership entirely, entering into a new form of covenant with the Lord.<span class="my-p">(Yahweh)</span>

<h3>Yahweh</h3>
William G. Dever argues that the Book of the Law was actually composed by orthodox Yahwist priests, who attributed it to the legendary figure of Moses and then hid it in the Temple, where it would be dramatically discovered; in this way, a "miraculous new Word from Yahweh" would seem to have appeared, giving Judah a chance to redeem itself and save itself from the advance of the Neo-Babylonian Empire.<br>

He, along with his people, then entered into this new covenant with the Lord to keep the commandments of the Lord.<br>

Now, it seems to me that having a very young person as a leader can and usually leads to one being manipulated with disastrous outcomes.<br>

Researching more on this and another source puts Hashim II younger, at only 10 years when he succeeded his dad as Caliph of Corba.<br>
It also states that Al-Mansur actually held the young caliph as a prisoner.<br>

<h3>The anarchy - Fitna</h3>
<div class="image-container">

</div>
<p>
After al-Mansur died, political chaos ensued in al-Andalus.<br>
This period is remembered as the fitna (anarchy) in history, during which the caliphate was fractured by a violent power struggle.<br>
The result was the division of al-Andalus into many small kingdoms; at one point, there were up to sixty of these small kingdoms, which were known as taifas.<br>
Gharb al-Andalus was split into two large taifas‚ÄîBadajoz and Seville‚Äîand four smaller ones‚ÄîHuelva, M√©rtola, Silva, and Faro.<br>
In time, these smaller kingdoms were absorbed by Badajoz and Seville.<br>
</p>
<details><summary >Southern and central Portugal was part of Badajoz, which was ruled by the <span class="my-p">Berber family of Banu al-Aftas.</span>

<h3>Os Berberes</h3>

</div>
<p>
Aft√°cidas or Banu Alaftas were a dynasty of Arabized Berbers who inherited power in the Taifa of Badajoz, and who managed to maintain their rule during most of the 11th century (1022-1095).<br>
During the fitna (civil war) that led to the fall of the Umayyad caliphate of C√≥rdoba, in 1022, Abedal√° ibn Alaftas (from which the name of the Aphthacid dynasty derives), a former Berber mercenary, took power in Badajoz.<br>
<a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aft%C3%A1cidas">Aft√°cidas</a>
</p>
</framed-text>
</details>
<p>
Although the capital of this taifa was outside of modern-day Portugal, it encompassed most of it at the peak of its power.<br>
<strong>
Some scholars even believe that Badajoz was a precursor of modern-day Portugal, as it was near to achieving complete autonomy of the region.

<h3>The Christians attack -The Age of Parias</h3>
<p>
However, the fragmentation of al-Andalus inspired the Christian rulers of the north to react, and they resumed their attacks on the Iberian Peninsula.<br>
This caused the death of the taifas since they had no power to resist such attacks individually and displayed no intentions to unify against their common Christian enemy.<br>
Instead, the local rulers started bribing the Christians and paying them tribute in exchange for safety.<br>
This tribute was named parias, and the Umayyad princes institutionalized it.<br>
</p>
<blockquote>
Now, would you believe that around the year 1035 AD they were already running a protection racket.<br>
And I thought that it was the <strong>mafia</strong> that started this...<br>
I wonder if it went down like the video below?<br>

<p>
They spent enormous amounts of riches, so much so that the whole period of the 11th century in al-Andalus became known as the <strong>‚ÄúAge of Parias.‚Äù</strong><br> 
When Toledo fell to the Castilians in 1085, the system of paying tribute collapsed, and the danger of the Christian occupation became very real.
