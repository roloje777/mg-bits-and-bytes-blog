        <strong>Roman rule (3rd century BC - 4th century AD)</strong><br />
        <p>
          The first Roman invasion of the Iberian Peninsula occurred in 219 BC.
          Within 200 years, almost the entire peninsula was annexed to the Roman
          Republic, beginning the Romanization of Hispania.<br />
          The Carthaginians, Rome's opponents in the Punic Wars, were expelled
          of its coastal colonies.<br />

      <li>
        <strong>Germanic kingdoms (5th to 7th centuries)</strong><br />
        <p>
          At the beginning of the 5th century, Germanic tribes invaded the
          peninsula namely the Suevi, the Vandals (Silingi and Hasdingi) and
          their allies, the Sarmatians and the Alans.<br />

        <strong>THE MOORS IN PORTUGAL (711 AD - 1294 AD)</strong><br />
        <p>
          Large parts of Portugal were occupied by Islamic rulers from 711 until
          1294 beginning with an invasion by the Northern Umayyad Caliphate
          Africa.<br />
          Like the Romans before them, the Moors expanded their control over
          what is today Portugal from its main power base in Spain. They They
          came from the south and headed north and west.<br />

      <li><strong>The French (1807 - 1811)</strong><br /></li>
      <p>
        A crucial factor in Napoleon's ambitions for the Iberian Peninsula
        involved the conquest and domination of Portugal. There would be a total
        of three French campaigns in Portugal during this period – the first in
        1807-08, the second in 1809 and the third in 1810-11 – all of which
        resulted in a disastrous defeat.<br />
