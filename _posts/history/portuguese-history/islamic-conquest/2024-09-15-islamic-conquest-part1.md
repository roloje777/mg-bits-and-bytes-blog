It is said that the Iberian Peninsula was lost because of a prostitute.😮

<h2>Year 711 - The defeat of the Visigothic Kingdom</h2>

<p>
The Visigothic Kingdom was conquered exceptionally fast.<br>
In 711, Tariq ibn Ziyad crossed the Strait of Gibraltar with his army and defeated the Visigoth king Rodrigo in southern Baetica.<br>
Tariq was a commander of the Umayyad forces of North Africa, and after defeating Rodrigo, he led his army straight to the heart of the Iberian Peninsula.<br>
It is said that Tariq ibn-Ziyad, the Moroccan muslim leader, once on Iberian soil ordered his men to set all his boats on fire and said.<br>
<strong><i>"The sea is behind you, and the enemy is in front of you."</i> </strong><br>
This act essentially left his army with no option but to fight and conquer or perish.<br>
</p>
<p>
A Muslim source from the 9th century claims that when the Umayyads conquered North Africa and took over Tangier, one Visigoth outpost remained undefeated.<br>
This outpost was under the control of the count of Ceuta, Julian, who had sent one of his daughters (Florinda) to the Visigothic court at Toledo for education.<br>
This daughter was allegedly raped by King Rodrigo.<br>
When Julian heard of this, he used his connections to the Umayyads and helped them cross the strait on his merchant ships.<br>
Both Muslims and Christians sang ballads about it. <br>
While the Muslims praise the daughter of Julian and claim she was a sanctified virgin, the Christians sing about her as an evil seductress.<br>

<p style="margin-top:1em">
The real evidence shows that there was a civil war or at least a power struggle between the king and the nobles in the late Visigothic Kingdom.<br>
</p>
<p>
Tariq and his army were given not only merchant ships from Julian’s outpost but also his forts on the mainland.<br>
This helped them to launch a full-scale invasion.<br>

Tariq's success prompted the governor of North Africa, Musa ibn Nusayr, to cross the strait with a much larger army and continue the conquest of the peninsula.<br>

He occupied Toledo in 712 without much effort, as most of its inhabitants fled the city.<br>
By 716, the Muslims took control of all the important strategic points and main cities of the Iberian Peninsula.<br> They divided them between Musa ibn Nusayr, his son Abd al-Aziz, and Tariq—the three leaders who soon conquered the whole of Hispania.<br>
Wherever they turned, they encountered little to no resistance.<br>
</p>
<p>
The earliest existing source is from the late 10th century, and it only touches on the events from the Muslim point of view.<br>
But recent studies of the Chronicle of 754 (written by a Christian in Andalusia) suggest that there were Umayyad raids on Hispanic territory predating the conquest.<br>
That means that Tariq’s invasion wasn’t the first time the Christians and Muslims met on the battlefield and that perhaps the Visigoths even anticipated the Arab conquest.<br>
The conquest may have started as nothing more than a raid, and the Muslim goal was to loot the Iberian cities and return to Africa with their prize.<br>
</p>
<p>
The cities that accepted the surrender would have to pay tribute to the Muslims,as protection, else those cities would be conquered through battle and all males would be executed, woman and children would be enslaved.<br>
They were also allowed to keep their property, faith, and even local autonomy.<br>
The Christians did not believe in the tolerance of the Muslims, and many people fled the cities and hid in the mountains, expecting violence to erupt.<br>

<h2>A Kingdom For A Prostitute</h2>
<div style="display:block;width:80%;margin-right:auto;margin-left:auto;margin-top:1em">
<img src="https://image.jimcdn.com/app/cms/image/transf/dimension=778x10000:format=jpg/path/s70a410ad0e56ba5a/image/ib5f21b4835c8d1a8/version/1541876065/image.jpg">
<p style="text-align:center">Florinda the Cava</p>
</div>
<p>
I started this blog implying that the germanic kingdom on the Iberian peninsula was lost due to a prostitute.<br>
I'll now elaborate on this<br>
</p>
<p>
Do you recall from the above the mention of the count of Ceuta, named Don Julian.<br>
Well he had a daughter called Florinda.<br>
Seeking that his daughter had a good education and also a good husband, he sent her to the court of Toledo, where she entered the service of King Rodrigo.<br>
Well, the story goes that the Visigoth King Roderigo was besmitten with Florinda's beauty.<br>
One day Florinda was bathing in the river in the area where the tower is located, the king noticed her and, unable to stop his lust, forced himself on her and raped her.<br>
She sent a series of gifts to her father, including a rotten egg, <strong>a sign that she was now spoiled goods.</strong><br>
Don Julian  then planned his revenge and began talks with Musa ibn Nusair to disembark on the Iberian Peninsula.<br>
He facilitated the passage of the Muslim troops.<br>
King Rodrigo faced the Muslim troops in the lands of Guadalete, also betrayed by the supporters of Wittiza who deserted the day before the battle, leaving Rodrigo's troops in inferiority.<br>
They would lose the battle and the war at the hands of the Arabs who would conquer Hispania.<br>
As for king Roderigo, it is said that his jewels and robes were found on the bank of a blood-filled river, along with is horse Orelia, but his body was never found.<br>
</p>
<framed-text>
Alone upon the battle ground, beneath a dying star,<br>
Rodrigo stood in bleak despair, his hosts were scattered far;<br>
The King leapt onto his horse Orelia and fled the disastrous battlefield.<br>
Alone, he laments:<br>
Last night I was the King of Spain, today no fief command,<br>
Last night fair castles held my train, today bereft I stand,<br>
The sun shall set forever on my kingdom and my reign,<br>
The dawn will find no trace of me throughout this vast domain.<br>
</framed-text>
<p>
Now, the count (Don Julian) having betrayed the King of the Visigoths offered himself as a servant to Tarik, who responded <strong>" You have already betrayed your King and your country, I do not want dirty traitors among my people "</strong> and was accused of treason and later decapitated in the area of ​​Madridejos.<br>
It is said as a tradition that his head was displayed on the hill since then known as "Cabeza del Conde".
</p>
<p>
Ok, so that's the story on how the muslims enterred and conquered the region known as Hispânia by the romans.<br>
</p>
<framed-text>
<h3>Florinda la Cava</h3>
<strong>But, what does this have to do with a prostitute?<br></strong>
Well you recall "Florinda" sending the rotten egg to her father that started all of this?<br>
Florinda was seen wandering towards the River while shouting <strong>“I am Florinda la Cava (which means Florinda the prostitute) because of whom a nation was lost.”</strong><br>
</framed-text>
<p>
So this is the story on how the Visigoth Iberian Kingdom was lost to a prostitute.<br>
 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯<br>

... I've added a video of the chapel of bones in which the chapel is decorated with thousands of human bones found in the region of Évora Portugal.<br>
Its architecture is influenced by islam and that of the manualito era (King Manuel of Portugal) ...<br>
... I wonder how many of those bones are from the carnage left by Christians and Islams during the islamic invasion of Portugal....<br>
... looking at history, sadly, one can postulate that man is doomed to repeat errors of the past, in the name of their gods, or defending some prostitute....🤔💭"<br>
