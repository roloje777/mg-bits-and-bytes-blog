Portugal History - Gharb al-Andalus


Part 3


The Society and Economy of al-Andalus


Many Hispano-Romans converted to Islam after the establishment of al-Andalus. Other Muslims who settled in the peninsula were the Arabs, mostly Yemenis, and the Berbers. The Arabs comprised a small elite minority, while the Berbers represented the majority of the Muslim population of Iberia. They came from the Maghreb region in Africa. The migratory Muslims came to the peninsula in several waves over two centuries and settled mainly in Algarve and other southern regions. Their numbers were never large, and they never surpassed more than several thousand. Only a minority of the Muslim immigrants brought their families to the newly conquered territory. Most of the immigrants were young bachelors who intended to marry local women.

With such sparse numbers of immigrants, the majority of the Muslims in al-Andalus consisted of converts and their descendants. The neo-Muslims came from all levels of society, and they were called muwallads.

The Muslim society of al-Andalus was socially divided into the aristocracy (hassa) and the common people (amma),


The slave system was entrenched in al-Andalus as much as it had been in the Roman and Visigothic times. The Muslims often raided the Christian north of the peninsula and took slaves from there. They also traveled through Europe and crossed Gibraltar. They brought slaves from Christian kingdoms and sub-Saharan Africa, adding to the enormous diversity of Iberia. The Muslim rule of al-Andalus was heavily focused on the development of the cities, as they were an urban-oriented society. It is no wonder that during the Umayyad period, great cities, such as Córdoba, Seville, Lisbon, Coimbra, and Beja, developed into grand urban centers.


The society of al-Andalus was patriarchal, and although women held social positions equal to men, they had strictly family roles. This doesn’t mean they couldn’t become cultured. Women from the royal and aristocratic families were given an education, and they studied law and religion and wrote exquisite poetry. The majority of court women were slaves who either served as pleasure providers or who served the royal family. But Andalus rulers were known for often marrying their slave concubines, thus raising their social status.


The Christians remained in Iberia even after the Muslim conquest, though their numbers were significantly reduced. Many decided to convert to the faith of their conquerors, but many also decided to emigrate to other Christian countries in Europe. Those who stayed and remained faithful to Christianity but accepted the rule of the Muslims were called Mozarabs

The Mozarabs became a minority in al-Andalus by the 11th century. Jews were also present, though in very small numbers.
