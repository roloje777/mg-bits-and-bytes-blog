... I've added a video of the chapel of bones in which the chapel is decorated with thousands of human bones found in the region of Ã‰vora Portugal.
Its architecture is influenced by islam and that of the manualito era (King Manuel of Portugal) ...
... I wonder how many of those bones are from the carnage left by Christians and Islams during the islamic invasion of Portugal....
... looking at history, sadly, one can postulate that man is doomed to repeat errors of the past, in the name of their gods....ðŸ¤”ðŸ’­"

Part 1
The Islamic Conquest

The Visigothic Kingdom was conquered exceptionally fast. In 711, Tariq ibn Ziyad crossed the Strait of Gibraltar with his army and defeated the Visigoth king Rodrigo in southern Baetica. Tariq was a commander of the Umayyad forces of North Africa, and after defeating Rodrigo, he led his army straight to the heart of the Iberian Peninsula.
...


One Muslim source from the 9th century claims that when the Umayyads conquered North Africa and took over Tangier, one Visigoth outpost remained undefeated. This outpost was under the control of the count of Ceuta, Julian, who sent one of his daughters (Florinda) to the Visigothic court at Toledo for education. This daughter was allegedly raped by King Rodrigo. When Julian heard of this, he used his connections to the Umayyads and helped them cross the strait on his merchant ships. This episode may well be a legend, but both Muslims and Christians sang ballads about it. While the Muslims praise the daughter of Julian and claim she was a sanctified virgin, the Christians sing about her as an evil seductress. The real evidence shows that there was a civil war or at least a power struggle between the king and the nobles in the late Visigothic Kingdom.

...
Tariq and his army were given not only merchant ships from Julianâ€™s outpost but also his forts on the mainland. This helped them to launch a full-scale invasion.
...
initial success of Tariq prompted the governor of North Africa, Musa ibn Nusayr, to cross the strait with a much larger army and continue the conquest of the peninsula. He occupied Toledo in 712 without much effort, as most of its inhabitants fled the city. By 716, the Muslims took control of all the important strategic points and main cities of the Iberian Peninsula. They divided them between Musa ibn Nusayr, his son Abd al-Aziz, and Tariqâ€”the three leaders who soon conquered the whole of Hispania. Wherever they turned, they encountered little to no resistance.
...
The earliest existing source is from the late 10th century, and it only touches on the events from the Muslim point of view. But recent studies of the Chronicle of 754 (written by a Christian in Andalusia) suggest that there were Umayyad raids on Hispanic territory predating the conquest. That means that Tariqâ€™s invasion wasnâ€™t the first time the Christians and Muslims met on the battlefield and that perhaps the Visigoths even anticipated the Arab conquest. The conquest may have started as nothing more than a raid, and the Muslim goal was to loot the Iberian cities and return to Africa with their prize.
...
The cities that accepted the surrender would have to pay tribute to the Muslims, but the people were offered protection. They were also allowed to keep their property, faith, and even local autonomy. The cities that refused to capitulate were conquered through battle. All male citizens were executed, and women and children were enslaved. Most places chose to capitulate, though, so the conquest was achieved relatively peacefully. However, the Christians wouldnâ€™t believe in the tolerance of the Muslims, and many people fled the cities and hid in the mountains, expecting violence to erupt.
