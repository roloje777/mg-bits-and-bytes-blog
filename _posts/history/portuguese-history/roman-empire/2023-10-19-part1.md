    <p>
    Carthage was the strongest Mediterranean empire of the 3rd century BCE, and it seemed that Portugal would be absorbed by it.<br> 
    The south already belonged to the Carthaginian leaders, and they had a very strong military presence in the Iberian Peninsula.
    </p>

<h4>Second Punic War (218–201 BCE) started.</h4>

Before the Second Punic War, Rome never showed much interest in Iberia.  
But now, it was under their control, and they decided to stay since the peninsula offered cheap labor and rich deposits of minerals, as well as fertile land suitable for agriculture.  
In Spain, two Roman provinces were formed by 197 BCE: Hispania Citerior and Hispania Ulterior.  
The Roman control over these territories was predatory, as they exploited their riches and enslaved their people.  
This led to widespread discontent that very quickly escalated into open revolt.  
The people of the western shores of Iberia used the unrest in the Roman provinces to raid the Roman settlements.  
It soon became obvious that the empire would have to integrate the whole peninsula if they wanted to keep control over it.  
The occupation of southern Portugal was quick and easy, and it was over by the second half of the 2nd century BCE.  
It seems that a military expedition was not needed, as the conquest was completed through persuasion and diplomatic efforts.  
The native Conii people became Roman allies, and they handed administrative control over the Algarve and Alentejo to the Romans.

<h4>The Lusitanians</h4>

But the interior territories between the Targus and Mondego Rivers, as well as the mountainous regions in the north, were a different story.<br>
The Lusitani, Callaeci, and other peoples lived there, and they mounted a heavy resistance against the Roman Empire.<br>
It would take Rome 175 years to subdue the whole of Portugal.<br>
<br>
The Romans came to respect the Lusitani as an effective and elusive fighting force, even though they were enemies.<br>
Their leaders were the first Portuguese names recorded in history, albeit in Romanized form.<br>
Among them were Punicus, who raided in 155 BCE, and Caesarus, who defeated Roman General Mummius in 153 BCE.<br>
Perhaps the greatest Lusitani war hero was Caucaenus, who embarked on raids in the Roman-controlled Algarve, captured the Conistorgis (the capital of the Conii), and continued to cross the strait and raid in North Africa in 151 BCE.<br>
The Romans were very frustrated by the Lusitani raids.

        <h4>Viriato: Portugal’s Legendary Bad-Ass</h4>
        In 150 BCE, they organized a massacre in which the only survivor was Viriatus, a warrior who would later become the main leader of the Lusitanian resistance.<br>
        Viriatus is traditionally portrayed as a simple shepherd who became a guerilla leader capable of charming his fellow countrymen and inspiring the Lusitanian population to revolt.<br>
        He was active for seven years, between 146 and 139 BCE, during which he waged a bloody war against the Romans and inflicted several humiliating defeats on them.<br>
        The Romans were forced to use bribery to organize his assassination.<br>
        Viriatus became the first proto-Portuguese hero, but after his death, the Lusitani lost their will to fight.
        They turned their tactics into defensive ones since the raids no longer seemed worth their effort. <br>
        In 138 and 137, the Romans penetrated the Tagus Valley and started their campaigns in the north, going as far as Galicia. <br> 
        But they never managed to <strong>subdue</strong> the Lusitani, although they did contain them.
