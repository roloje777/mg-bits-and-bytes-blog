Viriathus, the latin name of Celtic origin, derived from <a href="https://www.behindthename.com/name/viriato">viriae</a> meaning <u>bracelets</u> <br>
My guess is that you all know that. <br>  
What you may not know is that it led to another meaning, that from Portuguese origin. <br>  
<strong>Viriato, One who wears the ruling bracelets.</strong>. <br>  
There was once a shepherd boy, turned prince, roaming the hills in northern portugal,
that led his men, only 6000 strong, to thrash the mighty romans. <br>  
The mighty roman army, were around 20 000 strong, with calvary and even on the back of elephants. <br>  
This happened even before Portugal became a kingdom. <br>  
He was the leader, the <strong>general</strong> of the brave <strong>lusitanians.</strong> <br>  
All, this you may know, and if you are Lusitanian (portuguese, spanish), you are proud of your ancestors and rightly so, just like my kids are. <br>  
After all their great-grandfather, was called Viriato, after this <strong>badass</strong> portuguese hero.<br>
By the way, in a previous blog (<a href="https://roloje777.github.io/mg-bits-and-bytes-blog/posts/history/portuguese-history/roman-empire/2023-10-19-part1">Portugal History - The Roman Empire - Part 1</a>), I discuss the Lusitanians , here I focus more on Viriathus.<br>

    Viriathus hailed from Lusitania, which occupied parts of modern-day Portugal and western Spain. He was a shepherd who in childhood lived in the mountains . Accounts recall his great strength and agility, the result of a spare diet and hard physical labour.
    He lived around 2nd century BC.
    He lead the Lusitanians to conquer stratigic areas such as: Seg√≥briga, La Mancha and B√©tica.
    <br>
    The confrontation of Erisane (located in the south of Andalusia), Viriato stopped the Roman forces in 141 BC., where he managed to siege the army led by F√°bio M√°ximo Serviliano.

  Servilianus was sent to Hispania Ulterior and was given command of the Lusitanian War. He took with him two legions and a number of allied forces, totaling 18,000 infantry and 1,600 cavalry. He asked King Micipsa, the king of Numidia, for some elephants, and received ten elephants and 300 cavalry.
Viriathus was around 6000 men strong.

Following this decisive confrontation, an agreement was reached with Serviliano. Viriathus accepted the agreement on behalf of his people and the Roman Senate recognized the independence of the Lusitanians, who now have the status of amicus populi romani (which means ‚Äúfriends of the Roman people‚Äù).

The peace did not last long, and a year later, Quinto Serv√≠lio Cepi√£o who took command, attack the Lusitanians.
Quintus Serv√≠lio Cepi√£o argued that Rome was dishonoured by the agreement established between Viriathus and Servilianus. The same was defended at that time by the Senate.

Viriathus sent three friends to serve as his ambassadors to renegotiate a piece treaty.
However, Minuro, √Åudax and Ditalco were bribed by the romans and when they returned from their mission, murdered Viriathus while he was asleep. Viriathus died in 139 BC.

<p class="vertical">
It is said that these three men that betrayed Viriato weren't Lusitanians, but from the Betic region.<br>
But, why would he trust non Lusitanians to negotiate for him?<br>

Well, in those times, the Betics were literate, they could read and write.<br>
A scracity in the region.<br>
When these three traitors, returned to Rome to get their rewards, they were killed and their corpses displayed publicly with the message that <strong>Rome does not reward traitors.</strong><br><br>
I wonder if that may be why we, the portuguese and spanish don't tolerate each other.ü§îüßêü§®‚ùì‚ùî<br>

T√°utalo was the successor of Viriathus. This was short-lived. The Lusitanians' desire for independence had been irreparably weakened!<br>

<h4>More information on Viriathus</h4>

<ol> 
   <li>Very little is known about the early life of the Iberian Celtic warrior Viriathus.
   Even the name Viriathus is actually a nickname given by the Romans rather than his true one.</li>

<li>The details of who Viriatus was prior to his military career are unknown but much speculated upon.
Some say he was a shepherd who became a warrior out of necessity, while others claim he was a Celtic Prince, or King. Much like our own Robin Hood, it has become all but impossible to disentangle the mythic origins of this hero from his true historic ones.</li>

<li>
Viriathus was the most successful leader in Iberia who ever opposed the Roman conquest.
   He was only defeated in battle against the Romans once, and from a military standpoint can be said to have been one of the most successful generals to ever have opposed Rome's expansion anywhere in the world.
   </li>

<li>In 146 BC Viriatus was elected Chief Of The Lusitanians, and he sought revenge for what had been done to his people.
</li>
<li>Viriatus employed two methods of warfare: bellum, in which he used normal military forces and tactics, and latrocinium, which involved small groups of combatants and the use of guerrilla tactics.
</li>

<li>Knowing that Viriatus was the figurehead of the entire rebellion Quintus Servilius Caepio hatched a plan.
   Three of Viriathus' men were offered riches and safety in exchange for one deed: upon their return they must kill their leader.
   And so they did.</li>

<li>Viriatus was assassinated while he slept in 139 BC<br>

<p>VISEU, Portugal: The Land of the Most Fearless Warrior</p>
The broad area of ‚Äã‚Äãcentral Portugal that has Viseu at its center and extends, between valleys and mountains, from Mondego to the Douro, constitutes a hub for successive human cultures. Tradition says that this was the homeland of Viriato.
