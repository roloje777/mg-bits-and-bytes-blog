<h4>The People of Roman Portugal</h4>

<p>As a result of the roman roads, professionals and merchants were now able to travel from one region to another without fear of entering enemy territory.<br>
They could travel from the peninsula to the other parts of the vast Roman Empire. Laborers migrated often looking for better work opportunities.<br>
 The mining industry in eastern Portugal became very popular as a work opportunity. Soldiers served in different parts of the empire, and even retired far from their homes. Slaves were moved wherever they were needed.
</p>
<p>Portugal's population reached one million by the late 1st century CE.<br>
A small elite minority and the sub-elite as well as slaves inhabited cities, towns, and villages.<br>
The elite minority left a deep and visible imprint in the history of Portugal with their mansions, villas, burial sites, temples, orchards, and carefully maintained documentation.<br>
To win over the leaders in the regions, rome gave them citizenship as well as principal municipal offices to hold.

<p>Portuguese natives rarely became Roman senators, but there are several names preserved in the Portuguese records.<br>
The slave system was crucial for the development of Roman Portugal.<br>
Slavery had existed in the country since the Carthaginians conquered it.<br>
Many Lusitanians and other natives of the Iberian Peninsula were enslaved at that time.<br>
</p>
<p>By the 1st century CE, a third of the Portuguese population were slaves.<br>
Slaves were also brought from different parts of the world.<br>
People in debt became slaves, children sold as slaves by their parents, and those whose ancestors were local slaves were born into slavery.<br>
They worked the fields, dug the mines, worked in the house, and performed various forms of service to the administration of the empire.<br>
Skilled na deducated slaves served as private tutors, doctors, scribes, accountants, business managers, and artists.<br>
Most of theses slaves were from Greece.<br>
Slaves could not own property or have legal families.<br>
</p>
<p>In Portugal, records show that some former slaves were freed managed to rise to management positions and gain wealth through commerce, various professions, and the mining industry.
