In 80 BCE there was a civil war amongst the Romans in Spain, which aloud the Lusitanians to reassert themselves.<br>
<br>
During this time, the Romans occupy the territories between the Tagus and Douro Rivers.<br>
The Lusitanians backed down and even served as mercenaries in the Roman army, especially during the war between Caesar and Pompey.<br>
The North still remained outside the Roman Empire.<br>
Emperor Augustus (63 BCE–14 CE), Caesar’s successor, campaigned in the area between 24 and 19 BCE conquering not only the north of Portugal but the whole Iberian Peninsula.<br>
<br>
They remained in Portugal for almost 450 years.

Portugal adopted the Roman traditions and the 1st and 2nd centuries CE saw the quick development of towns, with features such as central forums, baths, markets, amphitheaters, and aqueducts.<br>
Many Roman temples were built.<br>
<br>
The Romans didn’t think that the Portuguese coast was particularly attractive, which resulted
the coastal towns and cities being neglected, as they believed that the western frontier led nowhere, that it was the end of the world.<br>
This later became portugal's greatest trump, which led to a great empire, the portuguese empire (1415 - 1999 CE), that lasted almost six centuries.<br>
They did valued the rivers of Portugal, and build all their administrative centers along the river crossings that headed east.<br>

The main administrative center of the Portuguese Roman territory was Emerita Augusta (Mérida), and it was so far to the east that it was actually in Spanish Extremadura.<br>

The villas were built to exploit the agricultural and pastoral resources in the region.<br>
They were mainly built around the mines and had thick defensive walls.<br>

After the Flavian era (69–96 CE), the Romanization of Portugal slowed down.<br>
The building projects were finished, and there was no need for new ones.<br>
The construction of the new towns and cities would resume during the 4th century CE when the threat of barbarian invasions became real.<br>
During 4th century CE when the threat of barbarian invasions became real, new defensive points were built, and existing towns were given defensive walls.<br>
Deu to the adoption of Christianity, the abandonment of old temples in favor of new churches, the cities started assuming medieval in their appearances.<br>

  </video-container>
  <container-text>
    The Romans built roads, connecting the cities and towns, for military, administrative and commercial purposes.<br>
But the knowledge of the Roman roads in Portugal is very limited, although there is no doubt they were extensive.<br>
The majority of the roads were constructed to connect the west to the east since that was the preferred communication route.<br>
