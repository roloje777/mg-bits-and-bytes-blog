Portugal History - The Germatic invasion

Part 5


Religion and the Church 

The main institution that came with the rule of the Germanic kings was the Roman Catholic Church. It spread fast, and by the late 6th century, the church became the most powerful organization in western Iberia.
...
The Visigoths were Arians even before they came to Hispania, and they brought their faith with them.
-----

Who were the Arians and what did they believe?

Arianism is defined as an early branch of Christianity that held that Jesus Christ was not one with God the Father, but instead just created by God and a holy man.


The main difference between the beliefs of Arianism and other main Christian denominations is that the Arians did not believe in the Holy Trinity, which is a way that other Christian churches use to explain God.

Roman Catholicism differs from other Christian churches and denominations in its beliefs about the sacraments, the roles of the Bible and tradition, the importance of the Virgin Mary and the saints, and the papacy.

 They, too, would finally convert in 586 when King Reccared finally adopted Catholicism.
 But while the Visigothic royal family was still Arian, the majority of their subjects adopted Catholicism thanks to the works of various missionaries. 
Western civilization was firmly settled in Catholicism by the end of the 6th century, and it seems that the Visigothic kings had no other choice but to adapt to the situation. 
Arianism was anathematized during the Council of Toledo in 589. 
During the reign of the Germanic kings, the church was mainly an urban institution. 
Every major city had a complex of church buildings and properties clustered into precincts that included a central church, cemetery, chapels, a bishop’s palace, and other ecclesiastical buildings and land. 
Two metropolitan sees controlled the territory of what is today Portugal: Mérida and Braga.

In the countryside, the Christianization of the population was slow. Eventually, a system of parishes developed, and the first priests came to settle in the villages, replacing the missionary preachers. In Iberia, there was a strong sense of asceticism, and the first monasteries were modeled on those in the Middle East and North Africa.

What is asceticism in simple words?
the practice of strict self-denial as a measure of personal and especially spiritual discipline.

However, the specific origins of the monasteries in Portugal remain unknown. 
There are mentions of communities of nuns as early as the 5th century, especially in Braga, but the first monastic rule dates from a century later. Its founder was St. Martin of Braga, who converted the Suevic king to Catholicism. After the Visigothic Kingdom converted to Catholicism, the bishops supported the crown, and the church and the state started working together.
...
The Catholic Church in Hispania also had to face some challenges to establish its authority. The Hispano-Romans largely remained pagan in Gallaecia, except for the stubborn Arianism that remained active in the Visigothic communities. They continued to practice some of the Roman pagan customs, such as marriages on certain dates and the lighting of lamps and candles at major landmarks. They sometimes even continued worshiping ancient monolithic constructions.
...
But the most problematic challenge the Catholic Church experienced in Gallaecia was Priscillianism, named after a noble Priscillian who demanded radical reforms of the church during the last days of Roman rule in Hispania. He stressed the importance of studying the sacred texts, and he advocated the rigorous forms of asceticism, vegetarianism, and celibacy. He also insisted on the equality of men and women. 

---
Priscillianism was a Christian sect developed in the Iberian Peninsula under the Roman Empire in the 4th century by Priscillian. It is derived from the Gnostic doctrines taught by Marcus, an Egyptian from Memphis.
---

The existing Christian Church saw this as an effort to undermine its authority. Priscillian was eventually charged for sorcery, and the emperor found him guilty and ordered his execution in 386. Priscillianism persisted for the next two centuries. The Suevic conquest of Gallaecia didn’t help in suppressing this sect, and even once it was eradicated, it continued to echo throughout Gallaecian society. 
It is believed that Priscillian’s remains were brought back to Gallaecia and that he was buried under the cathedral at Compostela.

The main enemy of the church and Visigothic Catholic society during the 7th century were the Jews. They were seen as stubborn unbelievers.
...
the Jews were forbidden from assuming royal and administrative offices, owning slaves, and building synagogues. But the real persecution of the Jews began with King Sisebut (r. 612–621), who issued a policy of forced baptism. King Chintila (r. 636–639) expanded this policy. With the church’s approval, he brought about a decree by which all the Jews who would not accept baptism had to be expelled from his kingdom. The effective implementation of this new law never came, and the Jews continued to live within the realm. The later kings brought new decrees that discriminated against the Jews, ranging from the prohibition of circumcision and Jewish ceremonies to reducing the whole Jewish community to slavery. Their property was confiscated, and all Jewish children under six years old were taken away and given to Christian families.
