  <h4>The Germanic Kingdom</h4>

            <p style="text-align:center">The germanic Kingdom</p>
      </div>
  <p>
  It has been recorded in written sources that in 409 multiple groups of Vandals, Alans and the Suebi travelled through the Pyrenees.<br>
  When they arrived on the other side, into Hispania, it was recorded that the soldiers entered a frenzy of plunder, looting, and destruction.<br>
  The germanic people often did human sacrifices, hanging the bodies of their enemies as a way to intimidate their opponents.<br>
  <details><summary><strong>It was so bad that one contemporary writer, <span class="my-p">Hydatius,</span> claimed that it caused a famine that resulted in the locals resorting to cannibalism</strong>.</summary><br>  
  <framed-text><p>
    Hydatius, also spelled Idacius (c. 400 – c. 469) was a late Western Roman writer and clergyman.<br>
    The bishop of Aquae Flaviae in the Roman province of Gallaecia (almost certainly the modern Chaves, Portugal, in the modern district of Vila Real), he was the author of a chronicle of his own times that provides us with our best evidence for the history of Hispania in the 5th century.<br>
  </p></framed-text></details> 
  </p>
  <p>
    Toponyms that indicate old Germanic settlements are the places named Sa, Saa, Sas, in Galicia, or Sá in Portugal, all of which derived from the Germanic word sal- which can be translated to ‘house, hall’. It is found and distributed mostly around Braga, Porto, and in the Minho River valley in Portugal, and all around Lugo in Galicia, totalling a few hundred.

The term "barbarian" was used by ancient Greek and Roman scholars to refer to foreign peoples, including German and Celtic peoples to the north and the Hunnic and Slavic peoples to the northeast.<br>The migration of those peoples into the Mediterranean region led to the downfall of the Roman Empire.<br><a href="https://study.com/academy/lesson/barbarians-history-invasions.html">Barbarian Origin, Invasions & Kingdoms</a></p></framed-text></details>
Most importantly, <strong>they did not share the same ancestry and they did not give rise to what later became known as Germans.</strong><br>
Romans called the region between Rhine, Danube, Scandinavia, and the Black Sea Germania.<br>

    During the 3rd century CE, the <span class="my-p">Frankish</span> intruders plundered the Iberian Peninsula.<br> 
    They came as close as Tarraconensis, but never managed to penetrate what is today Portuguese territory.<br>

    <framed-text>
    The Franks were a western European people during the Roman Empire and Early Middle Ages.<br>
    They began as a Germanic people who lived near the Lower Rhine, on the northern continental frontier of the empire.<br>
    They subsequently expanded their power and influence during the Middle Ages, until much of the population of western Europe, particularly in and near France, were commonly described as Franks, for example in the context of their joint efforts during the Crusades starting in the 11th century.<br>
    This expansion came about because the romanized Frankish dynasties based within the collapsing Western Roman Empire first became the rulers of the whole region between the rivers Loire and Rhine, and then subsequently imposed power over many other post-Roman kingdoms both inside and outside the old empire.<br>

    <h4>The end to the Roma Empire in Hispania. (409-411 CE)</h4>
    <p>
        In the autumn of 409 CE bands of Vandals, Alans, and Suevi crossed the Pyrenees, Hispania with very little resistance, entering allaecia and Lusitania while pillaging, looting, and killing the residents.<br>
        The villagers fled looking for safety in the castros.<br>
        This led to an increase on the population in these cities which brought famine and a plague.<br>
        O enfraquecido Império Romano não tinha condições de enviar legiões para lutar nessas regiões.<br> 
        The  roman imperial authority in Lusitania and Gallaecia simply disappeared, never to return.<br>
        By 411 CE, the barbarians decided to divide Hispania among themselves and permanently settle there.

        The Alans were an ancient Iranian tribe mentioned in the first century AD by various classical authors such as Seneca (4 BC – AD 65) and Ptolemy (AD 100–170).<br>
        In the early history of the Alans, they appeared as a nomadic people who were especially renowned for their cavalry.<br>

        In 416,<span class="my-p"> the Visigoths,</span> which were roman foederati (foreign tribes, states, and peoples that had a treaty with Rome) entered Hispania and rekindled the violence, inhabiting Gaul.<br>
        They were chased by the Franks and moved south making a deal with the Alans and Vandals.<br>
        They retaliated, and under the leadership of their king Wallia (r. 415–418), they invaded Hispania and defeated the Alans in Carthaginensis and the Vandals in Baetica.

        The Visigoths were a Germanic people united under the rule of a king and living within the Roman Empire during late antiquity.<br>
        The Visigoths first appeared in the Balkans, as a Roman-allied barbarian military group united under the command of Alaric.<br>
        They did not settle in the region but left after their kings in 418 CE back to Gaul.<br>

    The Suebi (also spelled Suevi) or Suebians were a large group of Germanic peoples originally from the Elbe river region in what is now Germany and the Czech Republic.<br>
    In the early Roman era they included many peoples with their own names such as the Marcomanni, Quadi, Hermunduri, Semnones, and Lombards.<br>
    New groupings formed later, such as the Alamanni and Bavarians, and two kingdoms in the Migration Period were simply referred to as Suebian.<br>
    As the Suebi quickly adopted the local Vulgar Latin language, few traces were left of their Germanic tongue in the Galician and Portuguese languages.<br>
    Distinguishing between loanwords from Gothic or Suevic is difficult, but there is a series of words, characteristic of Galicia and northern half of Portugal, which are attributed either to the Suebi or to the Goths, although no major Visigothic immigration into Gallaecia is known before the 8th century.<br>

    The Kingdom of the Suebi also referred to as Kingdom of Galicia was a kingdom that sprung up after the fall of the Roman Empire.<br>
    One of the first to separate from the dying Roman system, it was based on the Roman provinces of Gallaecia and Northern Lusitania.<br>
    The Suebi claimed the land near the Atlantic shores and has been estimated to lie somewhere between the city of Porto and Pontevedra.<br>

  The Visigoths built a few temples, some of which have been restored over the centuries.<br>
  Examples include the São Gião Church near Nazare, the São Pedro de Balsemão Chapel in Lamego, the Santa Amaro Church (also serving as part of the Visigothic Museum) in Beja, and the Byzantine-style chapel of São Frutuoso near Braga.<br>
  The Visigoths also rebuilt the Roman town of Idanha-a-Velha near Castelo Branco and parts of its cathedral date from this time.<br>
  Also, many of the 92 villages of the Montesinho Natural Park in the Tras-Os-Montes province still bear distinctly Germanic names such as Fresulfe or Sernande, memorials to the Visigoths who founded them.

    During the fifth century, as Germanic tribes were settled within the Empire, they were romanized and eventually converted to Roman Catholicism.<br>
    The Franks were the first to be converted to Catholicism from their native tribal religion in 498.<br>
    <details>

          Now in Suebi kingdom the nobility were converted from paganism to <span class="my-p">Arian Christianity</span>.<br>
        </summary>
          <framed-text>
          Arianism, in Christianity, the Christological (concerning the doctrine of Christ) position that Jesus, as the Son of God, was created by God.<br>
          It was proposed early in the 4th century by the Alexandrian presbyter Arius and was popular throughout much of the Eastern and Western Roman empires.<br>
          God alone is immutable and self-existent, and the Son is not God but a creature with a beginning.<br>
          The Council of Nicaea (AD 325) condemned Arius and declared the Son to be “of one substance with the father.” <br>
          Arianism had numerous defenders for the next 50 years but eventually collapsed when the Christian emperors of Rome Gratian and Theodosius assumed power.<br>

    So before they converted, and I'm sure many did not, they brought with them their pagan belief system and spread it in the region.<br>

    <h4>The Berserkers</h4>
    <div>
            <img style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;border:solid 1px" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91RTxwYJhML._UF1000,1000_QL80_.jpg">
            <p style="text-align:center">Berserker</p>
         </div>
<p>
The berserkers and ulfhednars were fierce warriors who entered in a trance before battle.<br>
The name berserker might come from the old Norse language, Ber and serkir meaning bear-shirt or bear-coat.<br>
There is a controversial theory supported by several authors that the Germanic warrior tradition originated in hunting magic.<br>
Three animal cults appeared within this tradition: Bear, Boar and the Wolf cult.<br>
If we want to look at some more legit evidence of the existence of warriors dressed as either wolves or bears, we need to take a look at the Roman empire.<br>
Trajan's column which is located in Rome, depicts scenes of Trajan's campaignin 101-104AD.<br>
A few of these scenes depict Roman soldiers and allies around the border of the Empire which includes Germanic warriors.<br>
There are <strong>Germanic warriors depicted as bare-chested, bare-foot while wearing bearskins and wolfskins.</strong><br>
This is the only evidence we have before the vikings started to describe these warriors.<br>
According to some historians, Berserkers drew their power from the bear and were highly spiritual people.<br> 
During battle, they entered in a trance, they howled like wild beasts, gnawed the rims of their shields and were unable to feel any pain.<br>
They caused great panic and havoc amongst their enemies.<br>
The history of the wolf warriors date back to the indo-European people.<br>
We know that warriors dressed as wolves existed because of captured standards and shields by the Romans.<br>
They were incredibly similar to the Berserkers, also entering into a trance before battle.<br>
They were also known as Odin's warriors.<br>
