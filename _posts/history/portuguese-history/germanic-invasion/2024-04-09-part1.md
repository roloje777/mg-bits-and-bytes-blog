 Germanic tribes spoke languages that were similar, but individual tribes formed different local cultures.<br> 
Most importantly, <strong>they did not share the same ancestry and they did not give rise to what later became known as Germans.</strong><br>
Romans called the region between Rhine, Danube, Scandinavia, and the Black Sea Germania.<br>

    During the 3rd century CE, the <span class="my-p">Frankish</span> intruders plundered the Iberian Peninsula.<br> 
    They came as close as Tarraconensis, but never managed to penetrate what is today Portuguese territory.<br>

    The Franks were a western European people during the Roman Empire and Early Middle Ages.<br>
    They began as a Germanic people who lived near the Lower Rhine, on the northern continental frontier of the empire.<br>
    They subsequently expanded their power and influence during the Middle Ages, until much of the population of western Europe, particularly in and near France, were commonly described as Franks, for example in the context of their joint efforts during the Crusades starting in the 11th century.<br>
    This expansion came about because the romanized Frankish dynasties based within the collapsing Western Roman Empire first became the rulers of the whole region between the rivers Loire and Rhine, and then subsequently imposed power over many other post-Roman kingdoms both inside and outside the old empire.<br>

    <h4>The end to the Roma Empire in Hispania. (409-411 CE)</h4>
    <p>
        In the autumn of 409 CE bands of Vandals, Alans, and Suevi crossed the Pyrenees, Hispania with very little resistance, entering allaecia and Lusitania while pillaging, looting, and killing the residents.<br>
        The villagers fled looking for safety in the castros.<br>
        This led to an increase on the population in these cities which brought famine and a plague.<br>
        The weekend Roman empire could not afford to send legions to fight in this regions.<br> 
        The  roman imperial authority in Lusitania and Gallaecia simply disappeared, never to return.<br>
        By 411 CE, the barbarians decided to divide Hispania among themselves and permanently settle there.

        The Alans were an ancient Iranian tribe mentioned in the first century AD by various classical authors such as Seneca (4 BC – AD 65) and Ptolemy (AD 100–170).<br>
        In the early history of the Alans, they appeared as a nomadic people who were especially renowned for their cavalry.<br>

        In 416,<span class="my-p"> the Visigoths,</span> which were roman foederati (foreign tribes, states, and peoples that had a treaty with Rome) entered Hispania and rekindled the violence, inhabiting Gaul.<br>
        They were chased by the Franks and moved south making a deal with the Alans and Vandals.<br>
        They retaliated, and under the leadership of their king Wallia (r. 415–418), they invaded Hispania and defeated the Alans in Carthaginensis and the Vandals in Baetica.

        The Visigoths were a Germanic people united under the rule of a king and living within the Roman Empire during late antiquity.<br>
        The Visigoths first appeared in the Balkans, as a Roman-allied barbarian[1] military group united under the command of Alaric.<br>
        They did not settle in the region but left after their kings in 418 CE back to Gaul.<br>

        The Hasdingi were one of the Vandal peoples of the Roman era.<br>
        The Vandals were Germanic peoples, who are believed to have spoken an East Germanic language, and were first reported during the first centuries of the Roman empire in the area which is now Poland, eastern Germany, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia.<br>
        Famously, the Hasdingi led a successful invasion of Roman North Africa, creating a kingdom with its capital at Carthage in what is now Tunisia.<br>

    The Suebi (also spelled Suevi) or Suebians were a large group of Germanic peoples originally from the Elbe river region in what is now Germany and the Czech Republic.<br>
    In the early Roman era they included many peoples with their own names such as the Marcomanni, Quadi, Hermunduri, Semnones, and Lombards.<br>
    New groupings formed later, such as the Alamanni and Bavarians, and two kingdoms in the Migration Period were simply referred to as Suebian.<br>
