        It was in Brasileira do Chiado (Lisbon Portugal) that the term <strong>bica</strong> was born, which would be, among the various existing versions, the abbreviation for <strong>beba isso com aÃ§Ãºcar</strong> (drink this with sugar), an incentive to make coffee (a novelty at the time), more pleasant for customers , while they created the habit and scheduled a ritual.<br>
        Another version says that the name would come from the fact that the coffee was served directly into cups from the taps (or "spouts") of the machines where it was made, because customers considered that the intermediate passage to the coffee maker caused it to lose flavour, having the The term was adopted as a synonym for coffee, to this day.<br>

    The Visigoths were a Germanic group considered to have separated from other Goths around the fourth century, when they moved from Dacia (now in Romania) into the Roman Empire.<br> Over time they moved further west, into and down Italy, then to Spain -- where many settled -- and back east again into Gaul (now France).<br>
    The Spanish kingdom remained until the early eighth century when they were conquered by Muslim invaders.<br>
</p>
<p>
The origins of the Visigoths are obscure, but they were a Germanic people.<br>
It is believed their homeland was somewhere near Scandinavia, but there is no conclusive evidence to confirm this.<br>
They first came into contact with the Romans on the Danube frontier after they migrated southeast.<br>
<details>
<summary>They settled in Dacia, and there they were converted to<span class="my-p"> Arian Christianity</span> in the late 4th century.<br></summary>
<framed-text>
Arianism is a Christological doctrine considered heretical by all mainstream branches of Christianity.<br>
It is first attributed to Arius (c.â€‰AD 256â€“336),a Christian presbyter who preached and studied in Alexandria, Egypt.<br>
Arian theology holds that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, who was begotten by God the Father with the difference that the Son of God did not always exist but was begotten/made before time by God the Father;therefore, Jesus was not coeternal with God the Father, but nonetheless Jesus began to exist outside time.<br>

        Foederati were peoples and cities bound by a treaty, known as foedus, with Rome.<br>
        During the Roman Republic, the term identified the socii, but during the Roman Empire, it was used to describe foreign states, client kingdoms or barbarian tribes to which the empire provided benefits in exchange for military assistance.<br>
        The term was also used, especially under the empire, for groups of barbarian mercenaries of various sizes who were typically allowed to settle within the empire.<br>

        </div>
        Romulus Augustus (c. 465? â€“ after 511), nicknamed Augustulus, was Roman emperor of the West from 31 October 475 until 4 September 476.<br>
        Romulus was placed on the imperial throne by his father, the magister militum Orestes, and, at that time still a minor, was little more than a figurehead for his father.<br>
        After Romulus ruled for just ten months, the barbarian general Odoacer defeated and killed Orestes and deposed Romulus.<br>
        As Odoacer did not proclaim any successor, Romulus is typically regarded as the last Western Roman emperor, his deposition marking the end of the Western Roman Empire as a political entity.<br>
        The deposition of Romulus Augustulus is also sometimes used by historians to mark the transition from antiquity to the medieval period.<br>

        Odoacer (433 â€“ 15 March 493 AD), was a barbarian soldier and statesman from the Middle Danube who deposed the Western Roman child emperor Romulus Augustulus and became the ruler of Italy (476â€“493).<br>
        Odoacer's overthrow of Romulus Augustulus is traditionally understood as marking the end of the Western Roman Empire.<br>

    The Visigoths remained in power in most of southern and central Portugal until the Muslim conquest some 250 years later.<br>
    During their reign, much of Andalusia was reclaimed by the Eastern Roman Empire, and it possibly included small parts of southern Portugal.<br>
    Perhaps this is why Algarve was influenced by Byzantine culture.<br>

    <h4>Visigothic control over the Portuguese territory</h4>
    <p>
    Visigothic control over the Portuguese territory came in stages, and it took them a whole century to finish the process of creating their pan-Hispanic realm.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    The Visigothic kings never took up residency in the territory that is today Portugal.<br>
    Their capitals were in Toledo, Barcelona, Toulouse, and Tortosa.<br>

            <span class="my-p">Leovigild</span> faced a revolt launched by his son, who tried (and failed) to make a separate kingdom in Baetica and southern Lusitania.<br>
            Leovigild and his successor adopted quasi-Byzantine traditions, such as the use of the throne, the royal purple cloak, and an elaborate crown.<br>
            They enforced royal authority through civil and military judges who were authorized to punish offenders with mutilations and executions.

            Liuvigild, Leuvigild, Leovigild, or Leovigildo (Spanish and Portuguese), (c. 519 â€“ 586) was a Visigothic King of Hispania and Septimania from 568 to 586.<br>
            Known for his Codex Revisus or Code of Leovigild, a law allowing equal rights between the Visigothic and Hispano-Roman population, his kingdom covered modern Portugal and most of modern Spain down to Toledo.<br>
            Liuvigild ranks among the greatest Visigothic kings of the Arian period.<br>

            The successor of Leovigild, <span class="my-p">Reccared I,</span> converted from Arianism to Roman Christianity in 587.<br>
            The connection with the Byzantine court diminished, and the Catholic bishop of Toledo offered his strong support to the king in establishing central authority.<br>
            The Roman Church soon became a staunch upholder of the centralized government, and they even allowed the Visigothic kings of the 7th century to proclaim themselves as the priest-king (rex et sacerdos).<br>

            Reccared I (reigned 586â€“601) was Visigothic King of Hispania and Septimania.<br>
            His reign marked a climactic shift in history, with the king's renunciation of Arianism in favour of Roman Christianity in 587.<br>
            Reccared was the younger son of King Leovigild by his first wife.<br>
            Like his father, Reccared had his capital at Toledo.<br>
