<h2>Introduction</h2>
<blockquote>
In this blog I explore religion in the period when the region which is now known as Portugal was invaded by the germanic people.<br>
Now this is of particular interest to me as, as I cycle through the country side of Portugal and approach a small village I can clearly see the influence of the <strong>Church</strong>.<br>

I've noted that each village or town will have a chapel, probably at its center and a small chapel with the statue of Mary.<br>
You can follow me in my adventures <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@aventuras.J.adventures">here</a><br>¯\_(ツ)_/¯<br><br>
At the same time their is still a strong influence of the pagan beliefs in the people, such as the burning of candles and marring on certain dates.<br>
Is the custom of celebrating christmas actually a <strong>christian</strong> custom?<br>
Where does the tradition of the <strong> lighting of candles</strong> come from?<br>
Is the concept of <strong>"freeing of souls into immortality"</strong> a christian concept, or is it's roots lying somewhere else?<br>
Is the concept of heaven and hell a christian belief or did the idea come from the concept of the two Kingdoms - The kingdom of light and darkness?<br>
Have you heard of <strong>Saturnalia</strong> ?<br>
Have you heard of  <strong>Priscillianism></strong> ?<br>
Who was <strong>Arius</strong> and why was he poisoned ?<br>
What about the Jews?, were they in this region in that time period ?<br>
Did all the different religions and cultures get along ?<br>
These are questions I've been wrestling with as I explore the history of my forefathers and research further.<br>

<h2>Religion and the Church</h2>
<p>
The main institution that came with the rule of the Germanic kings was the Roman Catholic Church.<br>
It spread fast, and by the late 6th century, the church became the most powerful organization in western Iberia.<br>

        <p style="text-align:center">Peter</p>
        The first pope, Peter, led the early Christians and travelled to Rome sometime between the years 30 AD and 70 AD. We do not know the exact dates since there are few records from that era.<br>

    <p>
    Peter, like Christ, was regarded as a low rank who worked with his hands.<br>
    Although, Peter denied knowledge of Christ three times during his torture and crucifixion, it was Peter to whom Christ first appeared after he rose from the dead.<br> 
    And Jesus answered him, “Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jona! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven<br>
     And I tell you, you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the powers of death shall not prevail against it.<br>
     I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.”<br>

    St. Peter died as a martyr, crucified upside down on a cross during the reign of Nero, around 64 CE.<br>

    The place of Peter's crucifixion and his tomb were positioned on one of the seven hills of Rome, more specifically, the Vatican Hill.<br>
    That exact spot became the place of what is today Saint Peter's Basilica.<br>

It is uncertain exactly how much authority the Roman pope had over the Christian churches, primarily those in Asia Minor, the Holy Land, and Egypt.<br>
It's in the year 312 CE, during Constantine's reign that the pope  exercised authority over the church in Jerusalem and the center of development of Christian theology in Alexandria.

<h3>The Aryan Race.</h3>
Members of the SS deemed Aryans could be selected from populations of Volksdeutsche across Europe to create "master race".<br>
The Nazi Party established the organization NSDAP/AO to disseminate Nazi propaganda among the ethnic German minorities considered Volksdeutsche in central and eastern Europe.<br>
Nazi racial theories considered the "purest stock of Aryans" the Nordic people, identified by physical anthropological features such as tallness, white skin, blue eyes, narrow and straight noses, doliocephalic skulls, prominent chins, and blond hair, including Scandinavians, Germans, English and French,[94][95] with Nordic and Germanic people being the "master race" (German: Herrenrasse).<br>

<h3>Who were the Arians and what did they believe?</h3>
<p>
Arianism is a Christological doctrine considered heretical by all modern mainstream branches of Christianity.<br>
It is first attributed to Arius (c. AD 256–336),a Christian presbyter who preached and studied in Alexandria, Egypt.<br>
Arian theology holds that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, who was begotten by God the Father with the difference that the Son of God did not always exist but was begotten/made before time by God the Father; therefore, Jesus was not coeternal with God the Father, but nonetheless Jesus began to exist outside time.<br>
</p>
<p>
Arianism is defined as an early branch of Christianity that held that Jesus Christ was not one with God the Father, but instead just created by God and a holy man.
</p>
<p>
The main difference between the beliefs of Arianism and other main Christian denominations is that the Arians did not believe in the Holy Trinity, which is a way that other Christian churches use to explain God.
</p>
<p>
Roman Catholicism differs from other Christian churches and denominations in its beliefs about the sacraments, the roles of the Bible and tradition, the importance of the Virgin Mary and the saints, and the papacy.<br>

Just to elaborate a little one this, at the First Council of Nicaea, they (The Church) came down on Arianism and Arius was anathemised and condemned as a heretic once more at the ecumenical First Council of Constantinople of 381 (attended by 150 bishops).<br>
Arius was in Constantinople waiting to be readmitted into the Catholic faith when
he was found dead in his bathroom and it's believed that he was poisoned.<br>

They, too, would finally convert in 586 when King Reccared finally adopted Catholicism.<br>

But while the Visigothic royal family was still Arian, the majority of their subjects adopted Catholicism thanks to the works of various missionaries. <br>
Western civilization was firmly settled in Catholicism by the end of the 6th century, and it seems that the Visigothic kings had no other choice but to adapt to the situation. <br>
Arianism was anathematized during the Council of Toledo in 589. <br>
During the reign of the Germanic kings, the church was mainly an urban institution. <br>
Every major city had a complex of church buildings and properties clustered into precincts that included a central church, cemetery, chapels, a bishop’s palace, and other ecclesiastical buildings and land.<br>
Two metropolitan sees controlled the territory of what is today Portugal: Mérida and Braga.<br>

  <p style="position: relative; text-align: center">What is Asceticism?</p>
  <p>
    The practice of the denial of physical or psychological desires in order to attain a spiritual ideal or goal.<br> Hardly any religion has been without at least traces or some features of asceticism.<br>
  </p>
  <p>
  Abstinence and fasting are by far the most common of all ascetic practices.<br>
  Among the primitive peoples, it originated, in part, because of a belief that taking food is dangerous, for demonic forces may enter the body while one is eating. Further, some foods regarded as especially dangerous were to be avoided.<br>

Saint Martin of Braga (in Latin Martinus Bracarensis, in Portuguese, known as Martinho de Dume c. 520–580 AD), also known as Saint Martin of Dumio, was an archbishop of Bracara Augusta in Gallaecia (now Braga in Portugal), a missionary, a monastic founder, and an ecclesiastical author.<br>
He was later canonized by the Catholic Church for his work in converting the inhabitants of Gallaecia to Chalcedonian Christianity, being granted the cognomen of "Apostle to the Suevi". His feast day is 20 March.<br>

<h2>Challenges the Church faced</h2>

The Catholic Church in Hispania also had to face some challenges to establish its authority.<br>

The Hispano-Romans largely remained pagan in Gallaecia, except for the stubborn Arianism that remained active in the Visigothic communities.<br>

<h3>Saturnalia</h3>
<details>
<summary>
They continued to practice some of the Roman pagan customs, such as marriages on certain dates and the lighting of lamps and <span class="my-p">candles</span> at major landmarks.<br>
The Neoplatonist philosopher Porphyry interpreted the freedom associated with Saturnalia as symbolizing the "freeing of souls into immortality".<br>
Saturnalia may have influenced some of the customs associated with later celebrations in western Europe occurring in midwinter, particularly traditions associated with Christmas, the Feast of the Holy Innocents, and Epiphany.<br>
In particular, the historical western European Christmas custom of electing a "Lord of Misrule" may have its roots in Saturnalia celebrations.<br>

<h4>Candles</h4>
<p>
<details>
<summary>
Candles have been used as a source of light and to illuminate celebrations for more than 5,000 years.<br>
The earliest use of candles is often attributed to the Ancient Egyptians, who made rushlights or torches by soaking the pithy core of reeds in melted animal fat.<br>
The ancient Romans are generally credited with developing the wicked which they used used to light their homes, to aid travelers at night, <strong>and in religious ceremonies.</strong><br>
<span class="my-p">Hanukkah,</span> the Jewish Festival of Lights which centers on The lighting of candles, dates back to 165 B.C. <br>
The Emperor Constantine is reported to have called for the use of candles during an Easter service in the 4th century.<br>

<h3>Priscillianism </h3>
<details>
<summary>
The most problematic challenge the Catholic Church experienced in Gallaecia was <span class="my-p">Priscillianism</span>, named after a noble Priscillian who demanded radical reforms of the church during the last days of Roman rule in Hispania.<br>
He stressed the importance of studying the sacred texts, and he advocated the rigorous forms of asceticism, vegetarianism, and celibacy.<br>
He also insisted on the equality of men and women. 
</summary>
<framed-text>
<h3>Priscillianism</h3>
Priscillianism was a Christian sect developed in the Iberian Peninsula under the Roman Empire in the 4th century by Priscillian.<br>
It is derived from the Gnostic doctrines taught by Marcus, an Egyptian from Memphis.<br>
 Priscillianism was later considered a heresy by both the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church.<br>
 The Priscillianists taught a Gnostic doctrine of dualism, a belief in the existence of two kingdoms, one of Light and one of Darkness.<br>
 Angels and the souls of men were said to be severed from the substance of the Deity.<br>
 Human souls were intended to conquer the Kingdom of Darkness, but fell and were imprisoned in material bodies.<br>
 Thus both kingdoms were represented in man.<br>
 Their conflict was symbolized on the side of Light by the Twelve Patriarchs, heavenly spirits, who corresponded to certain of man's powers, and on the side of Darkness by the Signs of the Zodiac, the symbols of matter and the lower kingdom.<br>
 The salvation of man consists in liberation from the domination of matter. The twelve heavenly spirits having failed to accomplish their release, the Saviour came in a heavenly body that appeared to be like that of other men.<br>
 Through His doctrine and His apparent death, he released the souls of the men from the influence of earthly matter.<br>
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priscillianism">Priscillianism</a><br>
</framed-text>
</details>
<p>
The existing Christian Church saw this as an effort to undermine its authority.<br> 
Priscillian was eventually charged for sorcery, and the emperor found him guilty and ordered his execution in 386.<br>
Priscillianism persisted for the next two centuries.<br>
The Suevic conquest of Gallaecia didn’t help in suppressing this sect, and even once it was eradicated, it continued to echo throughout Gallaecian society. <br>
It is believed that Priscillian’s remains were brought back to Gallaecia and that he was buried under the cathedral at Compostela.<br>

  The main enemy of the church and Visigothic Catholic society during the 7th century were the Jews.<br>

<p style="text-align:center">Statue (as imagined) of Sisebut in Toledo</p>
But the real persecution of the Jews began with <span class="my-p">King Sisebut (r. 612–621)</span>, who issued a policy of forced baptism. King Chintila (r. 636–639) expanded this policy. With the church’s approval, he brought about a decree by which all the Jews who would not accept baptism had to be expelled from his kingdom. The effective implementation of this new law never came, and the Jews continued to live within the realm. The later kings brought new decrees that discriminated against the Jews, ranging from the prohibition of circumcision and Jewish ceremonies to reducing the whole Jewish community to slavery. Their property was confiscated, and all Jewish children under six years old were taken away and given to Christian families.
