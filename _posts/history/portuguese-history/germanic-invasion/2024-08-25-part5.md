<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h2>Religion and the Church</h2>
<p>
The main institution that came with the rule of the Germanic kings was the Roman Catholic Church.<br>
It spread fast, and by the late 6th century, the church became the most powerful organization in western Iberia.<br>

        <p style="text-align:center">Peter</p>
        The first pope, Peter, led the early Christians and traveled to Rome sometime between the years 30 AD and 70 AD. We do not know the exact dates since there are few records from that era.<br>

    <p>
    Peter, like Christ, was regarded as a low rank who worked with his hands.<br>
    Although, Peter denied knowledge of Christ three times during his torture and crucifixion, it was Peter to whom Christ first appeared after he rose from the dead.<br> 
    </p>
    And Jesus answered him, “Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jona! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven<br>
     And I tell you, you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the powers of death shall not prevail against it.<br>
     I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.”<br>

    The place of Peter's crucifixion and his tomb were positioned on one of the seven hills of Rome, more specifically, the Vatican Hill.<br>
    That exact spot became the place of what is today Saint Peter's Basilica.<br>

It is uncertain exactly how much authority the Roman pope had over the Christian churches, primarily those in Asia Minor, the Holy Land, and Egypt.<br>
In the year 312 CE, during Constantine's reign that the pope  exercised authority over the church in Jerusalem and the center of development of Christian theology in Alexandria.

The Visigoths were <span class="my-p">Arians</span> even before they came to Hispania, and they brought their faith with them.<br>
</summary>
<framed-text>
<h3>Who were the Arians and what did they believe?</h3>
<p>
Arianism is a Christological doctrine considered heretical by all modern mainstream branches of Christianity.<br>
It is first attributed to Arius (c. AD 256–336),a Christian presbyter who preached and studied in Alexandria, Egypt.<br>
Arian theology holds that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, who was begotten by God the Father with the difference that the Son of God did not always exist but was begotten/made before time by God the Father; therefore, Jesus was not coeternal with God the Father, but nonetheless Jesus began to exist outside time.<br>
</p>
<p>
Arianism is defined as an early branch of Christianity that held that Jesus Christ was not one with God the Father, but instead just created by God and a holy man.
</p>
<p>
The main difference between the beliefs of Arianism and other main Christian denominations is that the Arians did not believe in the Holy Trinity, which is a way that other Christian churches use to explain God.
</p>
<p>
Roman Catholicism differs from other Christian churches and denominations in its beliefs about the sacraments, the roles of the Bible and tradition, the importance of the Virgin Mary and the saints, and the papacy.<br>

<blockquote style="margin:5px;padding:5px">
Just to elaborate a little one this, at the First Council of Nicaea, they (The Church) came down on Arianism and Arius was anathemised and condemned as a heretic once more at the ecumenical First Council of Constantinople of 381 (attended by 150 bishops).<br>
Arius was in Constantinople waiting to be readmitted into the Catholic faith.<br>
He was found dead in his bathroom and it's believed that he has poisoned.<br>
</blockquote>
<p>
They, too, would finally convert in 586 when King Reccared finally adopted Catholicism.<br>
But while the Visigothic royal family was still Arian, the majority of their subjects adopted Catholicism thanks to the works of various missionaries. <br>
Western civilization was firmly settled in Catholicism by the end of the 6th century, and it seems that the Visigothic kings had no other choice but to adapt to the situation. <br>
Arianism was anathematized during the Council of Toledo in 589. <br>
During the reign of the Germanic kings, the church was mainly an urban institution. <br>
Every major city had a complex of church buildings and properties clustered into precincts that included a central church, cemetery, chapels, a bishop’s palace, and other ecclesiastical buildings and land.<br> 
Two metropolitan sees controlled the territory of what is today Portugal: Mérida and Braga.<br>

  In the countryside, the Christianization of the population was slow.<br>
  Eventually, a system of parishes developed, and the first priests came to settle in the villages, replacing the missionary preachers.<br>

  In Iberia, there was a strong sense of <span class="my-p">asceticism</span>, and the first monasteries were modeled on those in the Middle East and North Africa. 
  </summary>
  <framed-text>
  <h3>What is asceticism?</h3>
  <p>
    The practice of the denial of physical or psychological desires in order to attain a spiritual ideal or goal.<br> Hardly any religion has been without at least traces or some features of asceticism.<br>
  </p>
  <p>
  Abstinence and fasting are by far the most common of all ascetic practices.<br>
  Among the primitive peoples, it originated, in part, because of a belief that taking food is dangerous, for demonic forces may enter the body while one is eating. Further, some foods regarded as especially dangerous were to be avoided.<br>
