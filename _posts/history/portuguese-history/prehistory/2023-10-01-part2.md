### The Mesolithic Age

[The Mesolithic Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesolithic) are a transition from large chipped stone tools and hunting in groups of large herd animals to smaller ( microliths ) chipped stone tools and a more hunter-gatherer culture.  
 It ends with the introduction of the growing of crops and animals that are raised for meat in the Neolithic period.

In this periodic in the region now called Portugal they were still hunter-gatherers.  
As the weather improved and food was more abundant, they gather nuts, seeds, fruit, and even fished.  
Traps, spears, fishing hooks, and barbs were used.  
They spent different seasons in different areas.  
Permanent huts were built near beaches and on river banks, and they no longer used animal-skin tents.  
This Mesolithic way of life persisted in Portugal longer than elsewhere in Europe, due to the fact that the climate in the area was good and predictable, which means there was no need for humans to adapt to new conditions.

This is a complex of megaliths, and it is considered to be the biggest in Europe and is dated to the 6th millennium BCE.  
The function of these monoliths remains a mystery, but it is believed they were either used as primitive astronomical observatories or had religious connotations.

### The Neolithic period

[The New Stone Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic), is characterized by the beginning of a settled human lifestyle.  
People cultivated plants and domesticate animals for food.
This lifestyle first appeared in the central and southern coasts and slowly spread to the interior of Portugal.  
The northern territories were the last to adapt to the new lifestyle.  
During a long period Mesolithic and Neolithic societies lived side by side.  
This was over by 4000 BCE, in which for the next two thousand years, the Neolithic culture dominated.  
Legumes, cereals were cultivated and the herding of pigs, sheep, and cattle.

The southern Portuguese territory was one of the first European areas where copper was excavated and where copper tools were made (2500 BCE).  
 The abundance of copper in Portugal led the development of new technology such as copper axes, daggers, saws, and ornaments.  
The bronze industry developed as the people discovered tin in the southern regions.  
But even before this, the people of Portugal developed what is called a secondary product revolution: the techniques of resource production and the utilization of agriculture and herding.  
They learned how to ride horses and use animals for transportation and plowing fields.  
They drank cow’s milk, producing wool and textiles, and using ploughs and irrigation systems.

During this period of extensive copper production, Bell Beaker pottery appeared in Portugal.  
This is one of the most attractive and aesthetically pleasing forms of prehistoric pottery production.

The major manufacturers of such pottery in Portugal were in the areas of Lisbon and Setúbal.
