        <strong>Roman rule (3rd century BC - 4th century AD)</strong><br />
        <p>
          The first Roman invasion of the Iberian Peninsula occurred in 219 BC.
          Within 200 years, almost the entire peninsula had been annexed to the
          Roman Republic, starting the Romanization of Hispania.<br />
          The Carthaginians, Rome's adversary in the Punic Wars, were expelled
          from their coastal colonies.<br />

        <strong>Germanic kingdoms (5th - 7th centuries)</strong><br />
        <p>
          In the early 5th century, Germanic tribes invaded the peninsula,
          namely the Suevi, the Vandals (Silingi and Hasdingi) and their allies,
          the Sarmatians and the Alans.<br />

        <strong>THE MOORS IN PORTUGAL (711 AD - 1294 AD)</strong><br />
        <p>
          Large parts of Portugal were occupied by Islamic rulers from 711 until
          1294 beginning with an invasion by the Umayyad Caliphate from North
          Africa.<br />
          Like the Romans before them the Moors extended their control over what
          is now present-day Portugal from their main power base in Spain. They
          came from the south and drove north and west.<br />

      <li><strong>The French (1807)</strong><br /></li>
      <p>
        The invasion of Portugal (November 1807) saw an Imperial French corps
        under Jean-Andoche Junot and Spanish military troops invade the Kingdom
        of Portugal, which was headed by its Prince Regent João of Bragança
        (John of Braganza).<br />
        The military operation resulted in the occupation of Portugal.<br />
        The French and Spanish presence was challenged by the Portuguese people
        and by the United Kingdom in 1808.<br />
        The invasion marked the start of the Peninsular War, part of the
        Napoleonic Wars.<br />
        Threatened by an ultimatum from Napoleon, the Portuguese government
        acceded to most of the demands of the French emperor.<br />
        Nevertheless, Napoleon ordered Junot to commence the invasion, with the
        cooperation of three divisions from the Kingdom of Spain.<br />
        Paralyzed by fear and indecision, the Portuguese authorities offered no
        resistance. Junot occupied Lisbon on 30 November 1807, only to find that
        João and many of the leading families had escaped to Brazil aboard the
        Portuguese fleet.<br />
        The French quickly occupied the entire country and appropriated or
        disbanded the Portuguese army.<br />
        The following year saw the Portuguese revolt against their occupiers.<br />
        The next action was the Battle of Évora in July 1808.<br />
