 <blockquote>
    It' been around three months since we were all full of hope and planning our new goals.<br>
    After all, its was a new year, so a new opportunity to improve on our previous years performance.<br>
    It's not uncommon for us to be filled with hope at New Years Day and put ourselves on the spot by making resolutions, such as exercising regularly or stop smoking, just to find a little later in the year that it was all in vain.<br>
    After all, we've been doing this for the last 4000 years.<br>
    But why did our Babylonian ancestors do it in March?ðŸ¤”<br>
    Maybe one should check those new year's resolutions, just to make sure one is not going off track.<br>
    ðŸ’¡ Or, wait a moment.<br>
    Doesn't one have a chance to reset one's resolution on the 25th of March? <br>
    Maybe, we should ask the Pope<br>

    <h4>A long time ago</h4>
    <p>2000 BCE, the new year was celebrated during the time of the vernal equinox as the Sun crosses the celestial equator going north, which was around March 25.<br>
    Around 153 BCE, the Romans started celebrating New Year on the 1st of January because it was during that time when the newly elected Roman consuls started their one-year tenure in office.

    <h4>The Julian Calendar</h4>
    <p>Around 45 BCE, Julius Ceasar introduced the improved Julian calendar as it was based on the movement of the sun.<br>
    This calendar has 365 days in a year with an additional leap day every fourth year.<br>
    It was used by the Romans, and new year was on the 1st January.<br>
    It is still used as a religious calendar in parts of the Eastern Orthodox Church as well as the Berbers.<br>
    Later on, this calendar was later found to be inaccurate as well.

  <container-text>
    <h4>Christiansâ€™ Annunciation Day</h4>
    <p>In the Middle Ages, especially in Europe, the New years Day was moved to 25th March to correspond with Annunciation Day.<br>
    This is believed to be the day angel Gabriel announced to Mary that she would conceive a son.<br>
    According to Luke 1:26, the Annunciation occurred "in the sixth month" of Elizabeth's pregnancy with John the Baptist.<br>
    Many Christians observe this event with the Feast of the Annunciation on 25 March, an approximation of the northern vernal equinoxnine full months before Christmas, the ceremonial birthday of Jesus.<br>
    In England, this came to be known as Lady Day.<br>
    It marked the new year until 1752.<br>

  <container-text>
    <h4>The Gregorian calendar</h4>
    <p>The Julian calendar was replaced by Pope Gregory XIII in October 1582.<br>
    It was introduced to correct the miscalculations of the Julian calendar.<br>
    The principal change was to space leap years differently so as to make the average calendar year 365.2425 days long, more closely approximating the 365.2422-day 'tropical' or 'solar' year that is determined by the Earth's revolution around the Sun.<br> 
    It's only differs by 11 minutes compared to it's predecessor the Julian calendar.<br>
    <blockquote>
        You will not believe the difference 11 minutes makes.<br>
        I'm writing this post on the 17th of March 2024 and if I look at the Julian date, it's the 4th March 2024.<br>

    The 1st of January was once again introduced as New Years Day.<br>
