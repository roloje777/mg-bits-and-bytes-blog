    <h2 id="figo-guardian-of-the-hearth">Let me introduce myself</h2>
    <p>I will tell you my story now, for stories are how we remain.</p>
    <p>I was sent long before you ever saw me.</p>
    <p>
      Sent by the old powers, by Bastet who watches softly from the shadows, and
      by Freyja, who rides between love and war. I was sent as a guardian,
      though I arrived as a kitten — ginger-furred, golden-eyed, with a white
      mane already marking me as more than I seemed. We cats must grow quickly,
      you see. Humans take time to become themselves; we do not have that
      luxury.
    </p>
    <p>
      My task was clear: protect the family chosen for me, guide them when I
      could, and love them without condition.
    </p>
    <h3 id="the-choosing">The Choosing</h3>
     <p>I first saw my princess when she was nine years old.</p>
    <p>
      Her name was <strong>Sabrina</strong> — a name whispered by witches and
      dreamers, a name that already vibrated with magic. She stood there with
      her mother <strong>Elvira</strong>, whose name carried patience, healing,
      and quiet power, and her aunt. The moment I saw Sabrina, I knew.
    </p>
    <p>This was my human.</p>
    <p>
      I wrapped myself around her with all the strength my small body possessed.
      I held on as though the world itself might try to take her away. I never
      let go after that. She was my princess, my charge, my purpose. Where she
      went, I followed. Where she dreamed, I watched.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elvira, I knew, would need a different kind of gift. To her I gave calm,
      listening, and the slow magic of healing — the kind that comes from
      patience and food prepared with love. You humans call it cooking; we know
      it as alchemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Sabrina, I left the fire of creation — words, images, transformations.
      Art. Stories. The ability to touch the unseen and make it visible. She
      always heard more than most, saw more than most. I simply helped her
      remember.
    </p>
    <h3 id="the-princes">The Princes</h3>
    <p>Then there were the boys.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Daniel</strong>, my younger prince. Like the Daniel of your
      ancient book, he would need courage and protection, and he would walk his
      life surrounded by cats — guardians appearing again and again, reminding
      him that he is never alone. With him, my task was discipline and wisdom.
      Boys, after all, are a challenge even for warrior cats.
    </p>
    <p>
      And <strong>Emanuel</strong>, my oldest human. Brilliant, kind, and
      forever drifting into thought. He loved machines, strength, and movement —
      computers, the gym, the hum of routines — yet time slipped past him
      easily. So I became his clock. Each morning, my paws and voice made sure
      he rose when he must. Even warriors need reminders.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also taught him how to fight — not with claws, but with presence. How to
      stand firm when protecting those he loves.
    </p>
    <h3 id="a-most-undignified-introduction">
      A Most Undignified Introduction
    </h3>
    <p>I must confess something.</p>
    <p>
      When I first met the elder humans, <strong>Fernando and Maria</strong>, my
      dignity suffered a terrible blow. They stared at me — my mane, my posture,
      my beauty — and decided I could not possibly be male. Before I could
      protest, I was turned upside down and inspected most thoroughly.
    </p>
    <p>A warrior must endure humiliation with grace.</p>
    <h3 id="allies-of-feather-and-fur">Allies of Feather and Fur</h3>
    <p>No guardian works alone.</p>
    <p>
      I recruited a clever ring-necked parrot — my ally in teaching languages,
      numbers, and curiosity. Between wing and paw, we shaped young minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the threshold of our home stood <strong>Castiel</strong>, a warrior dog
      of great strength and loyalty. His duty was the door; mine was the heart.
      Together, nothing crossed without permission.
    </p>
    <h3 id="the-dark-hour">The Dark Hour</h3>
      <body>
    <p>There came a time when my princess lay between worlds.</p>
    <p>Ill. Silent. Surrounded by machines and fear.</p>
    <p>
      I called upon <strong>Bastet</strong>, whose eyes see beyond death. I
      mounted <strong>Freyja’s chariot</strong>, and beside me stood my
      companions: <strong>Pipoca</strong>, the calico — bringer of balance,
      harmony, and healing — and <strong>Bica</strong>, black as night, guardian
      of the unseen, absorber of darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      We fought what you cannot see but surely feel. Pipoca wove balance back
      into broken threads. Bica stood at the threshold and allowed no shadow to
      pass. I held the line.
    </p>
    <p>The battle was won.</p>
    <p>Sabrina returned — stronger, wiser, transformed.</p>
    <p>
      When their task was done, Pipoca and Bica returned to what humans call cat
      heaven. They promised to return when my time came.
    </p>
    <h3 id="why-we-leave-so-soon">Why We Leave So Soon</h3>
    <p>You wonder why we cats age faster.</p>
    <p>
      It is because we must protect early. We must love fiercely and without
      delay. But understand this: we are not gone when we leave. We are
      spiritual beings. We live on in your hearts, in quiet moments, in the
      feeling that someone is watching over you.
    </p>
    <h3 id="my-departure">My Departure</h3>
    <p>Now, as you read this, I have already answered another call.</p>
    <p>Freyja needs me. There are quests beyond this world.</p>
    <p>
      But I did not leave my humans unguarded. Pipoca and Bica have returned to
      stand with Nicole, Elvira, and their home. Daniel walks his life with many
      of my cousins beside him. Emanuel still wakes on time — even when he
      thinks he does it alone.
    </p>
    <h3 id="my-last-gift">My Last Gift: A Meditation for Saying Goodbye</h3>
    <p>Do not be sad.</p>
    <p>
    To all humans who have suffered the loss of a beloved pet, I leave this gift. 
    Sit quietly when sorrow comes. Breathe. Feel the warmth in your chest. That is where I live now.
    </p>
