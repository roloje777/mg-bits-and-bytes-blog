The Flying Tigers, officially known as the First American Volunteer Group, were American pilots who fought in the Chinese Air Force during World War II between 1941 and 1942. They are best known for popularizing the shark’s-mouth design frequently painted American military aircraft. In addition, their now-famous unit insignia of a winged Bengal tiger was designed by the Walt Disney Company.

President Roosevelt agreed to allow American pilots to resign from the military in order to go serve in the Chinese Air Force—at this point the United States had not officially entered the war against the Japanese and wanted to maintain an appearance of neutrality.

Imitating a British Royal Air Force design, the volunteers painted shark’s mouths on their aircraft to make them more threatening. This was not known to their supporters in Washington, who gave them the nickname the Flying Tigers in the spring of 1941.

In the spring of 1942, Roy Williams, an artist for Walt Disney Studios, created the image of a cartoon winged Bengal tiger flying in a blue ‘V’ for the Flying Tigers. The design was used by the group after they were incorporated into the United States Army, and similar designs are still in use today in the Air Force.

Thanks to the Flying Tigers’ defense, the Japanese were unable to successfully invade China, and over the next two years the United States was able to defeat the Japanese army and liberate the region. The Flying Tigers continued to fight until July 4th, 1942 they were absorbed into the American Army Air Forces and renamed the 23rd Fighter Group.

During their short existence, the Flying Tigers only lost twelve planes and ten pilots in battle, while destroying almost three hundred Japanese aircraft.
