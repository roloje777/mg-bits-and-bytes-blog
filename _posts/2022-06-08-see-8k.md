Technology seems to accelerate at an alarming rate these days, and that’s certainly true when it comes to consumer electronics. When it was announced that this year’s Big Game would be broadcast in 8K, we started to wonder: can our eyes even see in 8K?

So here’s the low-down on what 8K really means and whether or not it’s time for you to invest in a new TV.

The difference between pixels and resolution

It’s important to understand that there’s a difference between pixels and resolution. When looking at HD, 4K, and now 8K TVs, the higher you go, the higher the resolution, or total number of pixels. Pixels are the individual points of light that make up a digital picture. For example, an 8K TV has 33, 177, 600 pixels. To note, the term 8K refers to the number of pixels (about 8000) displayed horizontally per line.

However, in human vision, eyes do not contain pixels. The closest comparison would be the rods and cones in your eyes that help you see. What’s more, what you resolve is the picture you are able to put together with your eyes and brain, not what necessarily exists in reality.

Since there are so many variables that come into play, there is no clear yes or no answer to “can we see in 8K?” In theory, at some distance, it is possible, yes. If you want to get a broad idea of what that distance might be, you can plug your TV’s screen size into Carlton Bale’s home theater calculator. For example, for a 50-inch 8K TV, you would need to sit two feet or less away from it in order to appreciate its full impact.
