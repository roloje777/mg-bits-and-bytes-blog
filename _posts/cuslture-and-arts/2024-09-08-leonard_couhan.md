Suzanne takes you down to a place by the river<br>
You can hear the boats go by, you can spend the night forever<br>
And you know that she's half crazy, and that's why you want to be there<br>
And she feeds you tea and oranges that come all the way from China<br>
<span class="my-p">rest of lyrics here ...</span>
</p>
</summary>
And just when you want to tell her that you have no love to give her<br>
She gets you on her wavelength, and lets the river answer<br>
That you've always been her lover<br><br>
And you want to travel with her<br>
And you want to travel blind<br>
And you think you'll maybe trust her<br>
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind<br><br>
And Jesus was a sailor when He walked upon the water<br>
And He spent a long time watching from a lonely wooden tower<br>
And when He knew for certain only drowning men could see Him<br>
He said all men shall be sailors then until the sea shall free them<br>
But He himself was broken long before the sky would open<br>
Forsaken almost human, He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone<br><br>
And you want to travel with Him<br>
And you want to travel blind<br>
And you think you'll maybe trust Him<br>
For He's touched your perfect body with His mind<br><br>
Suzanne takes you down to a place by the river<br>
You can hear the boats go by, you can spend the night forever<br>
And the sun pours down like honey on Our Lady of The Harbor<br>
And she shows you where to look amid the garbage and the flowers<br>
There are heroes in the seaweed, there are children in the morning<br>
They are leaning out for lov, e and they will lean that way forever<br>
While Suzanne holds the mirror<br><br>
And you want to travel with her<br>
And you want to travel blind<br>
And you think maybe you'll trust her<br>
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind<br>

The song is about Cohen's platonic relationship with a dancer Suzanne Verdal.<br>
</p>
<p>
Suzanne would invite Cohen to visit her apartment by the harbour in Montreal, where she would serve him Constant Comment tea, and they would walk around Old Montreal past the church of Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Secours, where sailors were blessed before heading out to sea.
</p>
<p>
Cohen had the <strong>hots</strong> for his female companian, and dreamed about making love to her, but all he ever got from her was a cup of tea.<br>
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø<br>
</p>
<p>
But that's not all, the poor bugger...<br>
As he explains in the opening in the video below, is that he never made a single "penny" on that song"<br>
Cohen signed away the rights to ‚ÄúSuzanne,‚Äù ensuring he would never make any money from the song.<br>
‚ÄúThe rights of it were stolen from me,‚Äù he says in a video of an early performance.<br>
Dude, that gal just gave you bad luck... üòÇü§£ü§£
<br><br>
<strong>So make sure you read something, before you sign it ...."</strong><br>
