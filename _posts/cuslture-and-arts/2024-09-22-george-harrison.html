  George Harrison was born in Liverpool, England on the 25th February 1943.<br />
  He became famous as the lead guitarist for the world rebound band , the
  Beatles.<br />
  His dad was a bus conductor and his mom worked at a local grocery store.<br />
  <details>
    <summary>
      He met Paul who invited him to join his band, then known as
      <span class="my-p">"The Quarrymen."</span>

      <h3>The Quarrymen</h3>
      The Quarrymen are a British skiffle and rock and roll group, formed by
      John Lennon in Liverpool in 1956, which evolved into the Beatles in
      1960.<br />
      Originally consisting of Lennon and several school friends, the Quarrymen
      took their name from a line in the school song of their school, the Quarry
      Bank High School.<br />

  As I've mentioned before Lennon and McCartney wrote and sang most of the songs
  the Beatles performed, but Harrison also contributed with original works such
  as, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Bother Me‚Äù (1963), ‚ÄúWhile My Guitar Gently Weeps‚Äù (1968), ‚ÄúHere
  Comes the Sun‚Äù (1969), and ‚ÄúSomething‚Äù (1969).<br />

  An example of such a song is <strong>"‚ÄòI Me Mine‚Äô ‚Äì Let It Be"</strong> where
