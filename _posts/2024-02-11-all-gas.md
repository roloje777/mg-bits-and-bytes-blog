One of the most spectacular successes of the past year is the complete independence from imported Russian gas achieved by Germany, which had been the product’s main importer. A key additional factor in the EU’s relative success was the decline in consumption of natural gas, estimated at 10-12 per cent in 2022. This decrease was possible partly due to the relatively high temperatures during the 2022-23 autumn and early winter, partly due to more ‘green behaviour’ in response to the energy crisis (such as turning down the indoor temperature or switching to heat pumps), and partly due to reduced industrial production.
In short, Moscow failed in its effort to blackmail EU member states through withholding gas.

On 24 February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine in an escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War that started in 2014. The invasion became the largest attack on a European country since World War II.

He said an objective of the invasion was the “demilitarization” of Ukraine. That would make it unable to join NATO, whose expansion into countries that were once within Russia's sphere of influence Putin views as an encroachment on its interests. He said another aim was the “denazification” of Ukraine.

As far as EU action to decouple from Russia is concerned, the fifth and sixth sanctions packages were of central importance. The EU also introduced an embargo on the import of Russian coal, which came into force in August 2022, and brought in a similar measure on Russian seaborne crude oil exports to the EU. And in late 2022 Germany completely banned the purchase of Russian oil. Together, these measures mean the supply of oil from Russia could fall by up to 90 per cent in 2023 compared to 2022 levels. Furthermore, the EU’s February 2023 embargo on Russian petroleum products could see their share of the European market fall to the lowest level in history.

> What has the USA got to do with all of this, or are they just full of gas? 🤔

The EU faces several problems in particular. To begin with, competition among LNG importers is expected to intensify in 2023, and the main difficulty for Europe could be a revival of demand for gas in China as well as American exporters’ growing interest in increasing supplies to this market.

### U.S. LNG Export Boom: Defining National Interests.

The first wave of U.S. LNG exports began only in 2016 (Alaska’s now-defunct Kenai Plant has not exported LNG since 2015), but the country is now the world’s largest exporter. The United States exported 86 million tons of LNG last year, according to Kpler, following the start-up of Calcasieu Pass LNG and the return to production at Freeport LNG. In December 2023, LNG exports reached an all-time monthly high of 8.6 million tons.

The United States and Qatar alone could account for 80 percent of global supply additions by 2030.

The stunning growth in U.S. LNG exports shook up the global gas industry over the past decade, altering flexibility and pricing structure in ways that have affected all major producers and consumers. Most U.S. LNG has been sold on a “free on board” basis, meaning that buyers take ownership of cargoes at the export terminal and arrange shipping. U.S. sellers typically offer destination flexibility, so buyers are free to send cargoes wherever they are needed and can command the highest price, provided that such exports are consistent with U.S. laws.

> Where does Europe gey its LNG from? 🤔

This has been replaced mainly by LNG from the US, which supplied 46% of EU LNG imports in 2023 and reliable pipeline gas imports from Norway (49% compared to 30% in 2021), North-Africa (19%) and Azerbaijan (7%).

Nord Stream (German–English mixed expression for "North Stream"; Russian: Северный поток, Severny potok) is a network of offshore natural gas pipelines which run under the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany to provide Western Europe with natural gas.

### Gazprom: Russia’s Political Weapon - The Greed of the West

For decades, European countries have been dependent on Russian gas imports. And they did it to themselves. The biggest culprit? Germany. Only after Russia declared war on Ukraine did the German government realize that Russia has been using gas as a weapon for a long time.

On 26 September 2022, a series of underwater explosions and consequent gas leaks occurred on the Nord Stream 1 (NS1) and Nord Stream 2 (NS2) natural gas pipelines, two of 23 gas pipelines between Europe and Russia. Both pipelines were built to transport natural gas from Russia to Germany through the Baltic Sea, and are majority owned by the Russian majority state-owned gas company, Gazprom.

Quoting the First Letter of St Paul to Timothy (6:2-12), the Pope said: “Those who want to be rich fall into temptation and deception, and the many foolish and harmful desires that plunge men into ruin and perdition”. Greed, he continued, is the “root of all evil.
