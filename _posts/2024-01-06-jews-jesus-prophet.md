> Being baptised as a Roma Catholic, I grew up believing in Jesus and that he is the way to salvation. \
> Later on, having relations with people of other beliefs and religions, I became aware that not all see Jesus in the same light. \
> One that really heightened my curiosity, were the Jews. \
> Why didn't they see Jesus as their saviour?. After all he is Jewish.

### Why the Jews don't believe that Jesus is the Messiah.

- The Jews believe in one God and that Jesus violates that belief. \
  God is incorporeal, he is internal, he is infinite. \
  God can't be born, God can't die. \
  Now taking a human form, belittles God, and the fact that Jesus dies on the cross makes God mortal.
- They believe by worshipping Jesus one is practising idolatry.
- They believe that the coming of the Messiah is related to events that have not happened yet, such as: \
  The rebuilding of the [Third Temple in Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Temple) \
  Now, when Jesus was on earth the Temple was still standing.
- The ingathering of the Jews to their homeland. \
  During Jesus' period the Jews lived in Jerusalem. \
  There was no exile.
- The Messiah is a person, not a deity. \
  They see Jesus as a mixture of Greek mythology and Jewish prophecy. \
  The messiah has to be a decent of king David. \
  So Jesus biological father would have to be Joseph and not God.
- The Messianic Age (age of peace) \

### The Messiah

The Messiah is the liberator of a group of people. \
The Messianic Age originated in Jerusalem and in the Hebrew bible in which a mashiach is a king or high priest. \
An anointed person, a physical descendent of king David. \
