Arnold describes his basic program, from his book [Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding](https://www.amazon.com/Encyclopedia-Modern-Bodybuilding-Arnold-Schwarzenegger/dp/0671633813) not as "basic" , meaning easy, but the basic program to build a solid foundation of muscle mass.
A foundation that one can then mould to a great physique.

In this video I go through his <strong>leg workout</strong>, doing it at my humble home gym.
Showing one that you don't need expensive equipment to train and improve on one's well-being.
