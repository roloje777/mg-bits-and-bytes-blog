    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <div class="image-container">
      <img

    </div>
    <p>
      Scrolling through a Facebook debate about Ventura’s latest comments on the
      burka, I couldn’t help but be shocked by some of the opinions people were
      throwing around. It made me think back to his controversial posters and
      the bigger question: how lawful and ethical is all of this? I did some
      soul-searching, a bit of research, and here’s my take — my 50 cents — on
      the matter.
    </p>
    <hr />

    <p>
      <em
        >Or: how a university class in Porto accidentally wandered into one of
        Portugal’s most uncomfortable conversations.</em
      >
    </p>

    <hr />
    <div class="image-container">
      <img
        src="https://www.sailing-360.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4302/2025/02/1442_1624960294.jpg?w=1000&h=1000"
        alt="Image of the bridge over the Riviera Porto"
      />
    </div>

    <p>
      The lecturer stood by the window, hands clasped behind his back, staring
      out across the river. The Douro flowed calmly below, catching the early
      sunlight like a lazy ribbon of silver. Rabelo boats drifted by as if they
      had nowhere urgent to be, and the opposite bank rose gently, painted in
      the pastel colours Porto reserves for postcards and tourists.
    </p>

    <p>It should have been peaceful. But it wasn’t.</p>

    <p>
      Dr. João Almeida — early sixties, black hair bravely resisting grey but
      clearly losing the battle — looked troubled. Not the “I forgot my glasses”
      troubled. The “how on earth do I explain this without starting a riot”
      troubled.
    </p>

    <p>He sighed quietly.</p>

    <p>
      <em>Law versus ethics.</em><br />
      <em>Freedom of speech versus discrimination.</em><br />
      <em>Censorship versus responsibility.</em>
    </p>

    <p>Simple topics. Nothing controversial at all.</p>

    <hr />

    <p>The morning bell chimed.</p>

    <p>
      The hallway’s muffled roar poured into the classroom like a floodgate
      opening. Backpacks thumped. Chairs scraped. Pens clicked with unnecessary
      aggression. Conversations bloomed and overlapped until the room buzzed
      like a caffeinated beehive.
    </p>

    <p>Then — silence.</p>

    <p>
      The students noticed the look on their lecturer’s face. The serious one.
      The “today we are not discussing exam dates” face.
    </p>

    <p>Dr. Almeida turned slowly from the window.</p>

    <p>
      “Good morning, ladies and gentlemen,” he said. “Today, I am giving you
      this period to prepare for Tuesday’s debate.”
    </p>

    <p>A hand shot up.</p>

    <p>“Which debate, Dr. João?” asked André, already suspicious.</p>

    <p>
      The lecturer smiled faintly — the smile of a man who knows chaos is
      coming.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>The Assignment</h2>
    <div class="image-container">
      <img
        src="https://img.freepik.com/free-vector/cheerful-professor-pointing-upward_1308-165846.jpg?semt=ais_hybrid&w=740&q=80"
        alt="Comic image of a professor"
      />
    </div>

    <p>
      “The class,” Dr. Almeida explained, “will be divided into two groups.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “One group will argue that André Ventura is acting within his legal right
      to freedom of expression with his posters and public statements.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “The other group will examine Portuguese law and ethics, and argue whether
      those same actions cross legal or ethical boundaries.”
    </p>

    <p>A pause.</p>

    <p>
      “And,” he added, “you must remember: legality and ethics are not the same
      thing.”
    </p>

    <p>
      A few students nodded. Some frowned. One quietly googled “what is ethics.”
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Fast Forward to Tuesday</h2>

    <div class="image-container">
      <img
        src="https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1146107040/pt/foto/teen-girls-debates-with-peers-in-class.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=k5KnI5iFScWjpmoxhKAfEwCBuFbsvZPyeQCnIUhHdsU="
        alt="Image of students having a debate"
      />
    </div>

    <p>Two speakers from each group stood at the front of the class.</p>

    <p>
      André — yes, <em>that</em> André — was representing Ventura’s position.
      The coincidence was not lost on the lecturer, who smiled at the universe’s
      sense of humour.
    </p>

    <p>
      Across from him stood Nicole, armed with notes, case law, and the
      unmistakable confidence of someone who had read more than just the
      headlines.
    </p>

    <p>The debate began.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>André Speaks: “It’s Just Free Speech”</h2>
    <div class="image-container">
      <img
        src="https://ijalr.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/freedom-of-speech.jpg"
        alt="Image of people with a post with the words Freedom Of Speech"
      />
    </div>

    <p>André cleared his throat.</p>

    <p>
      “Freedom of expression is protected by Article 37 of the Portuguese
      Constitution,” he began. “Political speech, especially, has strong
      protection.”
    </p>

    <p>He gestured dramatically.</p>

    <p>
      “When Ventura says things like
      <strong>‘Os ciganos têm de cumprir a lei’</strong> or
      <strong>‘As minorias do costume têm de cumprir a lei’</strong>, he is
      stating something technically true. Everyone must obey the law.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “That’s not a call to violence. It’s not saying anyone should lose rights.
      It’s not censorship-worthy. You can’t ban speech just because it makes
      people uncomfortable.”
    </p>

    <p>André paused, satisfied.</p>

    <p>
      “This is freedom of speech. And in a democracy, that freedom includes
      speech we don’t like.”
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Nicole Responds: “Law Is More Than Literal Words”</h2>

    <div class="image-container">
      <img
        src="https://as1.ftcdn.net/v2/jpg/02/26/88/14/1000_F_226881445_14Z1HMYyfCbfsQaa0pnRPznN8vTxPehH.jpg"
        alt="Image of a law book and a small the blind lady of the law holding a scale"
      />
    </div>

    <p>Nicole stepped forward.</p>

    <p>
      “Yes, freedom of expression exists,” she said. “But it is
      <em>not absolute</em>.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “In Portugal, freedom of expression is balanced against other
      constitutional rights: human dignity, equality, and non-discrimination.”
    </p>

    <p>She tapped her notes.</p>

    <p>
      “When a poster singles out a specific ethnic group — like Roma people —
      and implies they are uniquely responsible for breaking the law, it
      reinforces stereotypes.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “That’s why courts don’t just look at what is said, but <em>how</em> it’s
      said, <em>who</em> says it, and <em>what effect</em> it has.”
    </p>

    <p>“Nicole continued:”</p>

    <p>
      “A Lisbon court ordered these posters removed because they were found to
      be discriminatory. That means: in this case, the speech was ruled
      <strong>not protected</strong>.”
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Law vs Ethics (This Is Where It Gets Interesting)</h2>

    <div class="image-container">
      <img
      src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D12AQFf1ATD25OQZw/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0/1683123068337?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=BdgR81-IttIkR_-YpzNzffvZkWPZMzU-xKB0FxUdrn8"
      alt="Comic image of a character at an intersection having to choose
      bewteen lawe and ethics" />
    </div>

    <p>Dr. Almeida leaned back in his chair, clearly enjoying this part.</p>

    <p>Nicole continued:</p>

    <p>“Even when speech is legal, it may still be unethical.”</p>

    <p>
      “Ethics asks different questions than the law. Not ‘Can I say this?’ but
      ‘Should I say this?’”
    </p>

    <p>
      “As a party leader and influencer, Ventura’s words carry weight. He’s not
      just expressing an opinion — he’s shaping public perception.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “When you repeatedly highlight one minority group as a problem, you create
      social harm, even without explicit insults or violence.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “That’s why many people say this kind of language is irresponsible — even
      when it skirts legality.”
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>So… Is Ventura Acting Legally?</h2>

    <div class="image-container">
      <img
        src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D12AQFf1ATD25OQZw/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0/1683123068337?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=BdgR81-IttIkR_-YpzNzffvZkWPZMzU-xKB0FxUdrn8"
        alt="Comic image of a person drowning and a hand sticking out the see trying to grab the scale to save himself or herself"
      />
    </div>

    <p>The answer, inconveniently, is: <strong>sometimes</strong>.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>✔ Saying “everyone must obey the law” → legal</li>
      <li>✔ Criticising policies → legal</li>
      <li>
        ✖ Singling out an ethnic group in a way that reinforces prejudice →
        courts may intervene
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In at least one case, the courts did intervene. That means: not everything
      he did stayed within the law.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>And Ethically?</h2>
    <div class="image-container">
      <img
        src="https://www.scu.edu/media/mobi/blog-variants/Ethics-Blog-760x550-760x550.png"
        alt="A poster with ethic values such as choice, value, principles written on it"
      />
    </div>

    <p>This is where opinions diverge — but many agree on one thing:</p>

    <p>Ethical leadership requires care, restraint, and awareness of impact.</p>

    <p>
      Ventura’s supporters may see blunt honesty. Critics see calculated
      provocation.
    </p>

    <p>
      But few would argue that repeatedly targeting minorities promotes unity or
      social trust.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>The Lecturer’s Closing Thought</h2>

    <div class="image-container">
      <img
        src="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/brilliant-mathematical-researcher-standing-front-260nw-1868423551.jpg"
        alt="A image of a teacher in front of the class"
      />
    </div>

    <p>
      Dr. Almeida stood once more by the window, the Douro still flowing
      patiently outside.
    </p>

    <p>“The law,” he said, “tells us what is permitted.”</p>

    <p>“Ethics,” he added, “tells us what is right.”</p>

    <p>
      “And democracy,” he concluded, “depends on us understanding the
      difference.”
    </p>

    <p>The room was quiet.</p>

    <p>
      Some students nodded. Some frowned. Some reconsidered their social media
      posts.
    </p>

    <p>Outside, Porto carried on — unchanged, complex, and very much alive.</p>
