<p style="position: relative; text-align: center">Ancient temple to Greek god Zeus discovered in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula</p>

> I find it rather intriguing that Zeus was worshipped during the Greek(1200BCE - 323BCE), Roman (625 BCE - 476 ACE), and Byzantine (330 - 1453) eras.  
> Just as intriguing that he was still worshipped in the times when Jesus was on earth, as when the apostles Paul and Barnabas were in Lystria Greece, and healed a paralysed man, the people thought they were the gods Hermes and Zeus.  
> Now Paul never had met Jesus and was converted to a follower of Jesus 4 to 7 years after Jesus' crucifixion.  
> By the way, Paul is attributed to writing most of the New Testament.  
> In fact, scholars today still don't know with certainty who wrote most of the texts in the bible.
>
> Lastly, I find interesting that Zeus, also known as Zeus-Kasios, stands for God of the Sky, and that <fade-in-fade-out>D</fade-in-fade-out>eus and <fade-in-fade-out>Z</fade-in-fade-out>eus only differ in the first letter.  
> Also, note that <fade-in-fade-out>J</fade-in-fade-out>e<fade-in-fade-out>s</fade-in-fade-out>us differs only by one letter, <strong>S</strong> is used twice. (Remove the first s and replace J with D or Z)  
> Now the letters <strong>EUS</strong> in latin means <i>muscle that constitutes, has the form of, or joins a (specified) part, thing, or structures</i>  
> Lastly, the letter <strong>S</strong> <i>
> in Judaism, is the symbol for Shaddai, one of the names of God in the Hebrew Bible. Shaddai is usually translated as "Almighty" or "All-Sufficient". The letter S is also the symbol for Shalom, a Hebrew word that means "peace", "wholeness", "well-being", or "completeness"</i>  
> Interesting is that the symbol <strong>S</strong> is the symbol of <strong>Mercury</strong>, the roman god, the <strong>Son</strong> of Jupiter and Maia.  
> Now Jupiter is <fade-in-fade-out>Z</fade-in-fade-out>eus in Greek mythology, also referred to as, <strong>the Sky God</strong>

> Anu, the leader of the Anunaki, was referred to in the sumerian tablets as <strong>Father of the Sky, King of the God's.</strong> ü§î  
> The Annunaki are a group of deities in ancient Mesopotamian mythology.  
> They were believed to be associated with the sky and were considered to be the creators of humanity according to some ancient texts.

Egyptian archaeologists have unearthed the ruins of a Roman temple dedicated to Zeus in the Sinai Peninsula, continuing excavation work that first began in the early 20th century.          
The Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities announced April 25 that the discoveries were made during excavations by an Egyptian mission at the archaeological site in Tell el-Farma, known in ancient Egypt as Pelusium.  
The site is located just east of the Suez Canal.
