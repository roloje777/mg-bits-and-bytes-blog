"Bits and Bytes" is all about interesting bits of information that
I find all over the place, such as in books, the internet and friends
and family that share over social media platforms etc.

Over some extended time I built a repository of all these
"bits and bytes" and shared over various social platforms with
family and friends.

Now I decided to create a blog on the web, where anyone can access
this, myself included.

On a slightly personal note, I recall people saying that I always
was curious, as I'm sure you are.
